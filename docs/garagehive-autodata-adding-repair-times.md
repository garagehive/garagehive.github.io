# Auto Selection of Repair Times From Autodata
Auto selection from Autodata, is available for the Great Britain, Northern Ireland and Ireland Markets. Here's how to get to the repair times:
1. Open the document (can be a Jobsheet, Estimate, or Vehicle Inspection Estimate) with the vehicle for which you want to check the repair times, and then click on **Lookup** and select **Repair Times** from the menu bar.

3. The window that opens displays a list of the vehicle's various mechanisms, from which you can select the mechanism that you are working on repairing. The information guides you step by step based on where the parts are located in the vehicle.

5. Each labour description is added a **Group** with the respective document lines under it.
