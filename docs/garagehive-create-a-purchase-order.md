### Creating a Purchase Order directly from a Jobsheet
To create a purchase order directly from a Jobsheet:
<br>

**Option 1**
1. Open the relevant Jobsheet and scroll down to the **Lines** FastTab.
1. Select the **Type** column as **Item** and, if you know the part number or the item is in stock, start typing the part number or description in the **No.** column. 
1. Use a **Placeholder Item** number, such as **MISC**, for items that you don't know the part number. This will be the placeholder part number until you receive the items.
1. Enter the quantity to be ordered in the **Quantity** column.

2. Enter the supplier name to order from in the **Vendor No.** column. If there are several parts from the same supplier, enter the same supplier in all the item lines.
3. If, on the other hand, some items are from a different supplier, enter the relevant supplier name in the **Vendor No.** column. This will ensure that separate Purchase Orders are created for each supplier.
4. Select the **Purchase (Special)** checkbox column on all item lines that need to be ordered, even if they are from different suppliers.

5. Select **Parts** from the menu bar, then **Create Purchase Order(s)**. The purchase order will be created and its number will be indicated on the alert. If several suppliers are selected, an alert will be shown for each supplier.

6. The Purchase Order(s) have now been created and are ready for the parts to be ordered. The next step will be to receive the parts and post the Purchase Order.

7. When you receive and post the Purchase Order for parts ordered from a Jobsheet, the **Check** column  in the Jobsheet line is updated with a parcel icon (ðŸ“¦) to indicate that the items have been received as ordered.

8. Click on the parcel icon, to open the **Posted Purchase Receipt** of the part.

9. If the vendor selected does not have the items, or there is a problem ordering, you can unlink the Jobsheet from the purchase order by selecting the **Unlink From Purchase Document** action under **Parts** in the menu bar, allowing you to create a new purchase order with a different supplier.
10. Delete the lines from the previously created purchase order(s).

### Receive Items Without an Invoice
When the items are received in the garage, without an invoice it is possible to first receive them in the system and then when you get an invoice you post them using the invoice. To receive the items first:

2. Under the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Qty. to Receive** column, delete the quantity for the items yet to be received and leave only the quantity for the items to receive.

### How to Split a Purchase Order Across Multiple Invoices
At times, it's possible that the items listed in a Purchase Order will be delivered through multiple invoices. Here is how to effectively process the Purchase Order with the multiple invoices:
1. Open the Purchase Order with the items to be received.
2. Delete from the **Qty. to Receive** column, the quantity of the item that has a different invoice (or the invoice has yet to be received).

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices1.png)

3. Enter the date of the invoice in the **Document Date** field, ensure that the **Posting Date** is accurate, and enter the Invoice No. in the **Vendor Invoice No.** field.

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices2.png)

4. Select **Posting** and then **Post** from the menu bar.

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices3.png)

5. In the pop-up notification, select **Receive and Invoice** to receive and invoice the items in the vendor invoice that you have received.

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices4.png)

6. The **Quantity Received** and **Quantity Invoiced** columns of the items in the invoice are filled with the respective quantities. However, for the other items in other invoices, their quantities are still displayed in the **Qty. to Receive** and **Qty. to Invoice** columns, as the Purchase Order is still open.

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices5.png)

7. Repeat the procedure for all the remaining invoices, making sure to enter the correct **Document Date**, **Posting Date**, and **Vendor Invoice Number** for each invoice. 
8. After all the Items have been received and invoiced, the purchase order will be fully closed and posted, and will no longer be visible in the purchase order list.
