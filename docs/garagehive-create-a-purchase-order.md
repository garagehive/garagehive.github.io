### Creating a Purchase Order Directly from a Document
To create a purchase order directly from a document (Such as a Jobsheet, Estimate or a VI Estimate):
1. Open the relevant document and scroll down to the **Lines** FastTab.
1. Select the **Type** column as **Item** and, if you know the part number or the item is in stock, start typing the part number or description in the **No.** column. 
1. Use a **Placeholder Item** number, such as **MISC**, for items that you don't know the part number. This will be the placeholder part number until you receive the items.
1. Enter the quantity to be ordered in the **Quantity** column.

1. Select the **Purchase (Special)** checkbox column on all item lines that need to be ordered, even if they are from different suppliers.
1. Enter the supplier name to order from in the **Vendor No.** column. If there are several parts from the same supplier, enter the same supplier in all the item lines.
1. If, on the other hand, some items are from a different supplier, enter the relevant supplier name in the **Vendor No.** column. This will ensure that separate Purchase Orders are created for each supplier.

1. Select **Parts** from the menu bar, then **Create Purchase Order(s)**. The purchase order will be created and its number will be indicated on the alert. If several suppliers are selected, an alert will be shown for each supplier.

1. The Purchase Order(s) have now been created and are ready for the parts to be ordered. Click on the **Special Order Purchase No.** to open the Purchase Order. 
   
   ![](media/garagehive-creating-a-purchase-order4.png)

1. When you receive and post the Purchase Order for parts ordered from a Jobsheet, the **Check** column  in the Jobsheet line is updated with a parcel icon (ðŸ“¦) to indicate that the items have been received as ordered.

   ![](media/garagehive-parcel-icon-jobsheet-line1.png)

1. Click on the parcel icon, to open the **Posted Purchase Receipt** of the part.
1. If the vendor selected does not have the items, or there is a problem ordering, you can unlink the document from the purchase order by selecting the **Unlink From Purchase Document** action under **Parts** in the menu bar, allowing you to create a new purchase order with a different supplier.

### Create and Email the Purchase Order from a Jobsheet
Instead of simply creating a Purchase Order from the Jobsheet, you may want to create the Purchase Order and email it to the Vendor:

2. Select **Parts** from the menu bar, then the **Create and Email Purchase Order(s)** action to create and email the Purchase Order(s).

### Receive Items Without an Invoice
When the items are received in the garage, without an invoice it is possible to first receive them in the system and then when you get an invoice you post them using the invoice. To receive the items first:
1. Open the purchase order with the items to be received. 
2. Under the **Lines** FastTab, in the **Qty. to Receive** column, delete the quantity for the items yet to be received and leave only the quantity for the items to receive.
3. In the menu bar, select **Home** and then **Post**.

   ![](media/garagehive-posting-a-purchase-order1.png)

4. Select **Receive** from the pop-up notification and click **OK**.

   ![](media/garagehive-posting-a-purchase-order3.png)

   ![](media/garagehive-posting-a-purchase-order4.png)

### How to Split a Purchase Order Across Multiple Invoices
In some cases, the items listed in a Purchase Order (PO) may be delivered through several invoices. Here's how to effectively manage and process a Purchase Order with multiple invoices:
1. Open the Purchase Order containing the items to be received.
2. Adjust the **Qty. to Receive** column by removing the quantity of any items that are associated with a different invoice (or have not yet been invoiced).

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices1.png)

3. Enter the date of the invoice in the **Document Date** field, ensure that the **Posting Date** is accurate, and enter the Invoice No. in the **Vendor Invoice No.** field.

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices2.png)

4. Select **Home** and then **Post** from the menu bar.

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices3.png)

5. In the pop-up notification, select **Receive and Invoice** to receive and invoice the items in the vendor invoice that you have received.

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices4.png)

6. The quantities in the **Quantity Received** and **Quantity Invoiced** columns will be updated accordingly for the items included in the invoice. Items associated with other invoices will remain in the **Qty. to Receive** and **Qty. to Invoice** columns, keeping the Purchase Order open.

   ![](media/garagehive-purchase-order-with-multiple-invoices5.png)

7. Repeat this process for each remaining invoice(s), ensuring you accurately enter the **Document Date**, **Posting Date**, and **Vendor Invoice Number** for each one. 
8. Once all items have been received and invoiced, the Purchase Order will be fully closed and posted, and will no longer appear in the purchase order list.
