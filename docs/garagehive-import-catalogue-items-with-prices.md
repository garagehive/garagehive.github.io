# Importing Catalogue Items with Prices in Garage Hive
This feature enables garages to import catalogue items along with their prices in Garage Hive. This ensures that the catalogue list is updated with new items and that existing item prices and descriptions are up-to-date. This feature also makes it easy to quickly add catalogue items to the inventory with the updated prices, which streamlines the inventory management process. To import the catalogue items with prices:

1. Start by downloading the Excel template (CSV format) below, which you will use to add all the items you wish to add in the system.

   > # Download the Import Catalogue Items with Prices Template: <ins>[Import Catalogue Items Template](import-catalogue-items-with-prices.csv){:target="_blank"}</ins>

2. The excel template has the following fields available to fill:
