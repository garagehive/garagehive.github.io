## ITEM

![](media/garagehive-create-a-item-card4.png)

A. **No.**  - This needs to be the part number either from your supplier or set part number you wish to give a particular part. <br>  

*i.e. BF for Brake Fluid. So everytime you order this from any supplier you can use the same part number.* 

B.  **Description** - The description of the part. *This description will be what appears on the jobsheet/invoice.*

C.  **Type** - Select Inventory 

D.  **Base Unit of Measure** - Select the relevant unit of measure. <br>

*i.e.<br> 
BF - Brake Fluid - Unit of Measure = LTR (Litre)*<br>
*Bulb - Bulb - Unit of Measure = PCS (Piece)* <br>
*BP - Brake Pipe - Unit of Measure = MTR (Metre)*

E.  **Item Category Code** - This is pre-selected when chosing which item template for the item card. 

##  INVENTORY 

![](media/garagehive-create-a-item-card5.png)

A.  **Stockout Warning** - This is always preset to "Default (Yes)". This will alert you if you try and sell something out which is not in stock. 

This can be changed to "No" in certain scenarios. <br> 

*i.e. CONSUMABLES - You are wanting to add a Consumables Cost on your invoices rather than booking out specific parts each time.*

B.  **Prevent Negative Inventory** - This is always preset to "Default (Yes)". This will prevent you selling something out you do not have in stock.

This can be changed to "No" in certain scenarios. <br> 

*i.e. CONSUMABLES - You are wanting to add a Consumables Cost on your invoices rather than booking out specific parts each time.*

##  COSTS & POSTING

**DO NOT Create your own without discussing with a member of the Support Team.**  

##  PRICES & SALES
