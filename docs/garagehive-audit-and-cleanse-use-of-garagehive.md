# How to Audit and Cleanse the Use of Garage Hive System
As the Garage continues to use the Garage Hive system, it is important to make sure that the system is used efficiently and effectively. This is where a system audit/cleanse comes in. A system audit/cleanse helps in reviewing your current processes and workflows in order to continuously improve effectiveness and optimise the use of Garage Hive features. In this article, we'll look at what you can do on a weekly, monthly, and annual basis to audit and cleanse your system.

### Cleansing the Purchase Orders and Purchase Return Orders
To ensure your Purchase Orders and Purchase Return Orders list is cleansed:
1. Select the **Purchasing** menu from the navigation bar in the Role Centre, and then **Purchase Orders** to view a list of all open Purchase Orders.

   ![](media/garagehive-system-audit4.png)

2. Examine each Purchase Order and ensure that all open Purchase Orders are awaiting parts or an invoice. Make sure you understand why the parts are still in the Purchase Order; if not, remove them and delete the Purchase Order.
3. The same is true for Purchase Return Orders; select the **Purchasing** menu from the Role Centre's navigation bar, and then **Purchase Return Orders** to view a list of all open Purchase Return Orders and go through each one.

### Check Items to Return Report
After going through the Items list and removing the **Reordering Policy** for the items that are not supposed to be categorised as stocked, you can now check the **Items to Return** report so as to return the items that are not needed or write them off if necessary. To access the **Items to Return** report:
1. Select the **Reports** actions menu, **Additional** and then **Items to Return**.

    ![](media/garagehive-system-audit10.png)

2. The **Items to Return** report should be empty. You can create **Purchase Return Orders** for the items on the list (to return them to the supplier), click [here](garagehive-items-to-return.html) to learn more, or you can write the items off the system using an **Internal Jobsheet** (if the item has been lost), click [here](garagehive-internal-jobsheet.html) to learn more.

### Cleansing the Surveys
To ensure your Surveys are cleansed:
1. Scroll down to the **Customer Surveys** and **Internal Surveys** tiles in the Role Centre. Check that the **To Review** tile is zero.

2. If there are surveys in the **To Review** tiles, click on the tile, read the survey, and then click **Mark It Reviewed**.

## Monthly Routines
These routines should be done on a monthly basis.

### Cleansing the Schedule
To ensure your Schedule is cleansed:
1. Check that there are no double-stacked allocation entries for a single resource; if there are, move one of the allocations to a later time or day.

   ![](media/garagehive-system-audit23.png)

2. This is an example of how a schedule should look like.

   ![](media/garagehive-system-audit24.png)

3. The second thing to look for is any **blue (Pending - this is an allocation that hasn't been started)** or **red (On Hold - this is a paused allocation)** allocations from the previous period. Click on the **Previous Period** from the menu bar, and check to see if any of the allocations are blue or red; if so, move them to a future date.

   ![](media/garagehive-system-audit25.png)

### Cleansing the Items List
To ensure your Items are correctly categorised:
1. Select the **Catalogues** menu from the navigation bar in the Role Centre, and then **Items** to view a list of all the item cards created.

   ![](media/garagehive-system-audit6.png)

2. Select the filter icon on the right of the menu bar to reveal the **filter** panel.

   ![](media/garagehive-system-audit7.png)

3. Add a **Reordering Policy** filter to the filter panel by clicking the **+Filter** button and searching for Reordering Policy. In the **Reordering Policy** filter, select all the options apart from the one that is blank. The reason for selecting all except blank is that Garage Hive only supports **Maximum Quantity**, and by selecting all, you will be able to see any miscategorised item cards and you can amend them to Maximum Quantity.

   ![](media/garagehive-system-audit8.png)

4. Check the items on the filtered list and confirm that they are supposed to be categorised as stocked. If it is not supposed to be categorised as stocked, open the item card and select the **Reordering Policy** as blank.

### Cleansing the Customer Communications
Customer communications include the **Booking Reminders**, **Booking Confirmations**, **MOT Reminders** among other that have been set up in the system. You should always ensure that the notifications that you want to send the customers are enabled in the system.
1. In the top right corner, choose the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Customer Notification**, and select the related link. If any notification is set to **Send SMS** and/or **Send Email** make sure the **Enabled** is selected.

## Annual Routines
These routines should be done on an annual basis.

### Annual Stock-Take
After going through the entire auditing process, the final step is to take a physical inventory of the items in the system. Physical stock-takes enable comparisons between items in the system and those that are physically available. You cannot conduct a physical stock-take without first going through the system auditing processes. Follow this [link](garagehive-doing-physical-stock-take.html) to learn more about how to carry out a **Physical Stock-Take**.
