# Removing Customer Ownership from a Vehicle Card in Garage Hive
When a vehicle changes ownership, the previous owner may still receive reminders about the vehicle, even if they are no longer the owner. Here's how to remove the ownership from the vehicle:

1. Open the **Vehicle Card** in which the the ownership of the vehicle has changed, by selecting it from the Vehicles list in the Role Centre.
