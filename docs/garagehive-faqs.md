#### How can I see ahead of time when the Garage is busy and when it is free in Garage Hive?
Garage Hive helps you manage your workshop by allocating time slots in the schedule, rather than Jobsheets, so you can easily see when the garage is busy and when it is free.

See the article link below for more information.

#### Would Garage Hive be accessible offline if the Garage Hive servers went down?
Garage Hive does not have an offline mode. If Microsoft's servers (where the Garage Hive system is hosted) went down, which is extremely unlikely, I'm afraid you'd have to rely on pen and paper until service is restored; but Microsoft has an uptime of 99.99+%. Cloud software is used by millions of small businesses around the world.

#### Does Garage Hive calculate VAT on a cash or accrual basis?
There are two methods for calculating VAT, cash and accrual: 
   * With cash, you pay VAT based on payment you receive and claim it back from the payment you make within the VAT period, you can only claim or pay VAT once payments are made either way.
   * With Accrual, VAT is calculated at the point that invoices are raised regardless of when payments are made.Â 

Accrual is typically preferred for garages because a garage will owe more to its suppliers than it owes to its customers, allowing you to claim VAT on purchases in advance of payment for the goods, which is good for cash flow.

Because Garage Hive is built on Microsoft Dynamics, it only calculates VAT on an accrual basis, even when exporting to external accounting systems. So a business onboarding with Garage Hive that uses cash accounting would need to switch to accrual.

You can switch from cash to accrual at any time without notifying HMRC, but you must report and pay any outstanding VAT (whether your customers have paid you or not). You have 6 months to report and pay any outstanding VAT, ([Source](https://www.gov.uk/vat-cash-accounting-scheme/join-or-leave-the-scheme)).

#### Does Garage Hive use Sequential Invoice numbering?

In Garage Hive, we typically use our Jobsheet number series for the associated invoice, for example    job SJ00001 creates invoice SJ00001 and so on. This makes traceability extremely easy. Job numbers are created sequentially, but some jobs are invoiced before others, so job six can be invoiced before job two. Still, every number used can be accounted for even if it's deleted (because it's archived). The method of having gaps in the invoice sequence is acceptable to HMRC.

#### How does Garage Hive manage the numbering of invoices for the integrated accounting software?

Here's how Garage Hive manages various accounting software integration:
* **Sage 50** - Sage 50 integration, uses Garage Hive's invoice number as the invoice number in Sage 50 invoice.
* **Sage Accounting** - Sage Accounting integration, assigns its invoice number during the import process and attributes the Garage Hive invoice number as a reference on the invoice.
* **Xero API** - Xero API integration, uses Garage Hive's invoice number as the invoice number in Xero API invoice.
* **QuickBooks Online** - QuickBooks Online integration, uses Garage Hive's invoice number as the invoice number in QuickBooks invoice.
