>   When trying to post a Jobsheet I occasionally get a message which says "*Resource information is missing in Jobsheet Line No. ............. Labour ................*" What does this mean?

This is because there is no resource (technician) attached to a Labour Line. 

Technician's should get into the habit of selecting which Labour lines they have completed. This will automatically fill in the Resource Section within the jobsheet lines. 

If they have not done this you can either manually type the technicians user name in the resource column, alternatively select Add Resources to Lines within the Action Bar on the jobsheet. 

>   Does the system send out reminders?

Yes, Garage Hive can send out automated MOT, Service and Booking Reminders out. 

See video below how to set up customer notifications.
