## Report Visuals
The following visuals represent a quick and intuitive way to understand the performance or status of the corresponding KPI:

1. **Profit Margin**
   
      ![](media/garagehive-powerbi-profit-margin.png)
   
   This visual shows the percentage of profit margin. A higher profit margin is indicative of efficient cost management, a better competitive advantage, and effectiveness in generating profit from business operations. A lower profit margin may suggest that the business needs to reassess its pricing strategies, control costs, and explore new revenue streams.

2. **Tech Efficiency**
   
      ![](media/garagehive-powerbi-tech-efficiency.png)
   
   This visual illustrates the percentage of technicians' efficiency. High technicians' efficiency implies streamlined processes and optimised use of the resources in the business. A low technicians' efficiency may suggest that the processes and resources in place are not performing efficiently and can lead to operational issues.

3. **Item Margin**
   
      ![](media/garagehive-powerbi-item-margin.png)
   
   This visual represents the percentage of item margin. A higher margin on items contributes positively to the overall profitability of the business, while a lower margin on items impacts the overall profitability of the business.

4. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** 
   
      ![](media/garagehive-powerbi-net-promoter-score.png)
   
   This visual displays the NPS groups for customers. Green indicates the promoters, suggesting strong customer satisfaction and loyalty. Yellow represents passive customers, indicating some customer satisfaction but room for improvement. Red represents detractors, indicating high likelihood of customer dissatisfaction and potential issues.
