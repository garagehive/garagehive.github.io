## Jobsheet Report Visuals Explained
The following visuals represent a quick and intuitive way to understand the performance or status of the corresponding KPI:

1. **Profit Margin**
   
      ![](media/garagehive-powerbi-profit-margin.png)
   
   This visual shows the percentage of profit margin.

A low technicians' efficiency may suggest that the processes and resources in place are not performing efficiently and can lead to operational issues.

3. **Item Margin**
   
      ![](media/garagehive-powerbi-item-margin.png)
