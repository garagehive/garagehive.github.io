# Setting Up and Sending Internal Surveys

To enable the internal surveys, you need to call the **Garage Hive Support Team**, to help you in setting up the internal surveys. Here are contact details: **Phone:** - [**02031461164**](tel:02031461164), or **Email:** - [**help@garagehive.co.uk**](mailto:help@garagehive.co.uk).

To Create a new internal survey:
1. In the top-right corner, choose the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Surveys**,  and choose the related link.
2. From the **Surveys List** page, choose the **New** action.

3. You can manually enter the survey **No.** on the **Survey Card** page, or you can press the **Tab** or **Enter** key and the system will assign the survey **No.** from the number series.
4. Fill in the **Description** of the survey and select **Internal** as the **Type** of the survey.

5. Under the **Questions** sub-page, fill in the **Description** column with the survey questions, choose the response **Type** for the questions, and define the **Answer Options**.
   - **Single Choice** refers to a scenario in which the respondent selects the answer from the available options but can only select answer.
   - **Multiple Choice** refers to a scenario in which the respondent can select several answers from the available options.
   - **Text** is where the respondent writes down the answer in free text.
   - **Gradient** is where the respondent selects between 0 to 10 the likelihood of the answer, with 0 being **not at all likely** and 10 being **extremely likely** (it is an NPS style).

6. It is recommend using the **Protected Data** column on all internal surveys questions, as this will ensure that only the **Owner User** (the user who has created the survey) has access to the data collected.

7. In the **Participants Settings** FastTab, choose whether the **Owner User** should receive the survey responses by selecting the **Email Owner Results** slider.
8. Select the **Participant User Count** number to choose which users will receive the survey, and specify the **Internal Notification Method** as SMS, email or both.
