# Testing

We're almost there, I promise. In the **Online Booking Setup** page:
1. From the menu bar, select **Test Catalog Setup**.

2. This validates all of your **Online Booking Setup**, and if everything went well, no errors will be displayed; if not, the errors will be displayed as follows.
3. Clicking on the **Source** will open the relevant table.

    {% include tip.html title="Note" text="Warnings will not prevent the system from functioning, but Errors will. It is best practise to have no errors or warnings." %}

4. Once all errors have been resolved, select **Actions** from the menu bar to obtain the **Embed Script** (you can also get an embed script specific for online enquiry) and/or use the **Open Test Page** to verify your setup. Please wait 5 minutes after the errors have been cleared before testing to give the system time to validate the setup.
