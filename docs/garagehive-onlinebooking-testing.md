# Testing

We're almost there, I promise. Back in the **Online Booking Setup** page:
1. From the actions bar, select **Test Catalog Setup**.

2. This validates all of your **Online Booking Setup**, and if everything went well, no errors will be displayed; if not, the errors will be displayed as follows.
3. Clicking on the **Source** will open the relevant table.

    > **Note:**
    > 
    > **Warnings** will not prevent the system from functioning, but **Errors** will. It is best practise to have no errors or warnings.

4. Once all errors have been resolved, select **Actions** from the actions bar to obtain the **Embed Script** and/or use the **Open Test Page** to verify your setup. Please wait 5 minutes after the errors have been cleared before testing to give the system time to validate the setup.
