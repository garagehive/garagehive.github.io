# Processing a Vehicle Inspection Estimates (VIEs) in Your Trial

VIE in Garage Hive offer the ability to manage and monitor your up-sell, additional authorisation and estimates across all of your service staff.

### Carry out the vehicle checks from the checklist template

2. For each field, there is colour codes to indicate the level of priority required (refer to the colour key). 
3. Besides every colour codes, you can add a comment.

### Add items and labour to the vehicle inspection estimate and change status
From the role centre, you can check the status tiles of the vehicle inspection estimate.

After creating a VIE from the checklist, the status is **Awaiting Action**, to give the service advisor an alert to take action:
1. Click on the **Awaiting Action** tile to open the VIE list, and select the VIE to work on.
2. Add items and labour to the VIE according to the checks done.
3. Change the **VIE Status** to **Awaiting Authorisation** from the customer, which moves it from the **Awaiting Action** to **Awaiting Authorisation** tile.

### Add customer authorisation and copy the authorised lines to jobsheet
You've already communicated with the customer and been advised on what work needs to be done at this point. The following step is to approve the document lines. There are two methods for authorising the document lines:
1. The first is from the document lines:
   * Scroll to the right on the document until you reach the **Customer Authorised** column. Tick all of the lines that the customer has approved.
   * From the actions bar, select **Process** and then **Copy Authorized Lines to Jobsheet**. You have the option of creating a new jobsheet or merging it with an existing one; you can do either, depending on your preferences.

2. Alternatively, from the group items where the document lines have been added:
   * Scroll up to the section **Group Items** (see [Grouping document lines](garagehive-group-items-grouping-document-lines.html)), where the groups have already been created.
   * Select the group items that have been approved from the **Customer Authorised** column. When a group is checked, all document lines within that group are approved. A single document line that is already part of a group cannot be separately authorised.
   * From the actions bar, select **Process** and then **Copy Authorized Lines to Jobsheet**.

> The VIE is marked complete and archived after all the lines are approved, or you could change the VIE status to complete for archiving the unapproved lines.
