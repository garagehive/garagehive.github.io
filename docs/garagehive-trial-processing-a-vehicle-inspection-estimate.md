After creating a VIE from the checklist, the status is **Awaiting Action**, to give the service advisor an alert to take action:
1. Click on the **Awaiting Action** tile to open the VIE list, and select the VIE to work on.
2. Add items and labour to the VIE according to the checks done.
3. Change the **VIE Status** to **Awaiting Authorisation** from the customer, which moves it from the **Awaiting Action** to **Awaiting Authorisation** tile.

### Add customer authorisation and copy the authorised lines to jobsheet
At this stage, you have already communicated with the customer and advised on which work should be done. The next step is to authorise the document lines:
1. Scroll to the right on the document lines up to the **Customer Authorised** column. 
2. Tick on all the lines that the customer has approved. 
3. Click on **Process** from the actions bar, and select **Copy Authorised Lines to Jobsheet**. You are given an option to create a new jobsheet or merge it to an existing one; you could do either, depending on your preference. 
4. The VIE is now complete.
