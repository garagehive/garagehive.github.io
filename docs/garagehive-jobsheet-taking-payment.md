### Taking a payment in a Jobsheet 
When the job is complete and the financial information is correct. You now need to collect the payment from the customer and post the jobsheet.
1. Select **Payments/Posting** from the jobsheet's actions bar, then **Take Payment** to mark the customer's payment method and add the amount paid along the customer's payment method row.

### Adding resources to labour lines in a Jobsheet
Before posting the jobsheet, all labour lines must-have resource information added to them. There are several this can be done:
1. If the Technician uses the Technician **Confirmed** button on their device, the resources column will be pre-populated.

2. If a front-of-house staff member is familiar with the Technician's **Resource No.**, they can add this directly to the labour line and then press the **Tab** key to assign 100% of that labour line to that specific Technician.

3. If there are multiple technician's working on the job or there are multiple labour lines upon which a sole technician has clocked onto a job you can Select **Process** followed by **Add Resources to Lines**. This will either split the total time spent between multiple technicians on all lines or it will add 100% to all labour lines for the one specific technician.

4. If you post the jobsheet without adding the resources, you will be prompted to do so automatically before posting.

### Updating the items numbers and quantities
1. All item numbers must be updated from the **Placeholder Item**, such as **MISC, to their actual item numbers. Ensure that the quantities and prices of the items remain unchanged.

    - If all part numbers with **Placeholder Item** have not been updated/added to the jobsheet, the following error message will be displayed:
