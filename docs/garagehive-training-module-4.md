## Module 4 - Estimates & Vehicle Inspections

In Module 4, the focus is on differentiating between an Estimate and a Vehicle Inspection Estimate. You'll learn how to create an estimate and convert it into a Jobsheet. Additionally, you will understand how to process a Vehicle Inspection, convert it into an Estimate, and copy the approved work onto the Jobsheet.

In the training Modules we'll cover the following topics:

   |              |                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

####  How to Create an Estimate

The following steps outline how to create an Estimate in Garage Hive:

   |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Step 1** | Click on **Estimate** in the Role Centre, located under the **Actions** menu.                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | **Step 2** | Enter the vehicle registration number in the **Vehicle Registration No.** field. If the vehicle is already in the system, the customer linked to the vehicle will be added automatically.                                                                |
   | **Step 3** | For new vehicles, the vehicle data will be pulled from autodata. Create a new customer to link with the vehicle.                                                                                                                                         |
   | **Step 4** | In the **Lines** FastTab, add labour and items to quote the customer, along with their quantity and selling price. Use the **Placeholder Item** number for items that don't have item numbers.                                                           |
   | **Step 5** | Note that, you can also populate the estimate using the **Service Packages** or **Repair Times** as demonstrated in **Training Module 1** for Jobsheets.                                                                                                 |
   | **Step 6** | After pricing up the estimate, send an SMS or Email to the customer with the total price, or call the customer and discuss the estimate. Change the **Estimate Status** to **Awaiting Authorisation** under the **General** FastTab.                     |
   | **Step 7** | Once the customer authorises the Estimate, select **Process** from the menu bar, and then **Make Jobsheet** if the customer authorised everything.                                                                                                       |
   | **Step 8** | If the customer authorised only some of the lines in the Estimate, tick the authorised lines in the **Customer Authorised** column under the **Lines** FastTab. Select **Process** from the menu bar, followed by **Copy Authorised Lines to Jobsheet**. |
   | **Step 8** | After converting the Estimate to a Jobsheet, open the schedule and allocate the created Jobsheet to the date when the customer says they will book their vehicle.                                                                                        |
   |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

#### How to Process a Vehicle Inspection

The following steps outline how to process an arriving vehicle that was pre-booked:

   |            |                                                                                                                                                                             |
   | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Step 1** | Open the schedule to access the booking allocation.                                                                                                                         |
   | **Step 2** | Right-click on the allocation and select **Lookup**.                                                                                                                        |
   | **Step 3** | On the **General** FastTab, enable the **Vehicle on Site** slider to confirm that the vehicle has arrived.                                                                  |
   | **Step 4** | Allocate the key number for the vehicle in the **Key Tag No.** field.                                                                                                       |
   | **Step 5** | If the vehicle is staying overnight, enable the **Vehicle Staying Overnight** slider.                                                                                       |
   | **Step 6** | If there is a requested time and date to return the vehicle, enter the date in the **Requested Delivery Date** field and the time in the **Requested Delivery Time** field. |
   | **Step 7** | Scroll down to the **Comments** FastTab and add any customer comments.                                                                                                      |
   | **Step 8** | Ensure that the right items and labour are added in the **Lines** FastTab. Close the Jobsheet when done.                                                                    |
   | **Step 8** | The Job will now be ready to allocate to a technician.                                                                                                                      |
   |            |                                                                                                                                                                             |
