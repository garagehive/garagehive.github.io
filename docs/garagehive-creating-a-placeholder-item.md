After creating a placeholder item, you can add it to a document for items you have yet to receive a purchase invoice. To add it in a jobsheet, open the particular jobsheet and select **Item** from the **Type** column in the jobsheet lines. Start typing the placeholder item name in the **No.** column and choose it from the options. Add a description and unit price. The placeholder item can be used as many times as need be. You can as well [Create a Purchase Order for the Item from the Jobsheet](garagehive-create-a-purchase-order.html) (see below).
