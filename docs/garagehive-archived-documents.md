#   Archived Documents 

Whenever a document is deleted, this is not gone forever. It is placed into the relevant archived file. 

You can archive sales and purchase orders, quotes, return orders, and blanket orders, and you can use the archived document to restore the document that it was archived from.

You can archive sales and purchase orders, quotes, return orders, and blanket orders, for example because you want to save a copy of a document for reuse later. You can archive a sales or purchase document several times, saving a different archived version each time.

For archived documents where the original still exists and is not posted, you can use the **Restore** function to overwrite the original with the archived version of the document. This is practical if you need to restore the contents of a document to an earlier state.

For archived documents where the original is deleted, you can only reuse the content by copying the data, for example with the **Copy Document** function.
