# Archived Documents 
You can archive purchase orders, estimates, jobsheets, checklists, and so on if you want to save a copy of a document for later use.

### Types of Archived Documents

   - An **Estimate** or a **Vehicle Inspection Estimate** is archived when you delete it.
   - An archived estimate can be copied to another document using [**Copy Document**](garagehive-copydocument.html) function.
   - Using the **Restore** action from the archived document, you can restore the archived **Estimate** or **Vehicle Inspection Estimate**, where the original still exists and it's not posted.
