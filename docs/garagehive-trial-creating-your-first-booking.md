### Add customer details

If the vehicle was already added before, the customer details would be added automatically. If not:
1. Start typing the customer's name under the field **Customer** and press the tab button to create a new customer.
2. From the pop-up window that appears, add the customer's address by searching on **Lookup address from postcode**.
3. Add the customer's phone number and email address on the respective fields.
4. If you have payment terms agreed with a customer (trade), for example, they pay every 30 days from the invoice date, you can add the terms by scrolling down to the **Payments** section. 
5. Scroll up to add a credit limit on the **Credit Limit (LCY)** Field (if necessary)
6. Click close to create the customer's card.
