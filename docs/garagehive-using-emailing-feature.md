# Using Emailing Feature in Garage Hive
The emailing feature is available in Jobsheets, Estimates, Vehicle Inspection Estimates, and Checklists. Here's how to get the most out of the feature:
1. To use the Email feature, go to the document's actions bar and select **Email** for Estimates, Vehicle Inspection Estimates, and Checklists, or **Email Invoice** for the Jobsheets.

2. When you select the email option, the document is automatically attached to the email. You can find it at the bottom of the page under the **Attachments** FastTab.

3. The email signature (which includes the company name, phone number, and email address) and the logo on the email message body are obtained from the system's **Company Information** page. You can update them by entering **Company Information** into the top right corner search icon and selecting the related link. Fields to update are: **Name**, **Phone Number**, **Email**, or **Picture**.

5. You can now add the email **Message** body for the customer. You can format the message however you want by changing the different formats available at the bottom of the **Message** field, such as the font, font size, text colour, and so on.

6. To make it easier to manage the email **Message** body, create **Text Templates** that will allow you to reuse similar text across multiple emails that you send. Click on **Select Text Template** under the **Email Details** FastTab, then select **New** from the actions bar, enter the **Code** for the template (you can name it depending on what you put in the message body), select **Type** as **Email Body**, and then enter the **Message** body in the writing space under the **General** FastTab.

7. To add a template, click the **Select Text Template** link, choose the template, and then click the **OK** button. To insert the template into the **Message** body, select the desired position and press the **Ctrl+V** keys to paste the template.
