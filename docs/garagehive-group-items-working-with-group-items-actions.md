# Working With Group Items Actions
When it comes to using online documents, the group items feature is very important to understand how it works. We've created several actions to help you work around the group item feature in various documents, and we'll walk you through them.

## In this article
1. [Move up and move down actions](#move-up-and-move-down-actions)
2. [Adding service packages, repair times and service interval matrix actions](#adding-service-packages-repair-times-and-service-interval-matrix-actions)
3. [Duplicate group, merge groups and create alternative actions](#Duplicate-group,-merge-groups-and-create-alternative-actions)
4. [Creating service package version action](#creating-service-package-version-action)
5. [Matching approved line groups action](#matching-approved-line-groups-action)
6. [Adding checklist attention lines](Adding-checklist-attention-lines)


### Move up and move down actions
These actions are available in jobsheets, estimates, and vehicle inspection estimates and assist in rearranging the group lines in the group items sub-page.
1. Choose **Manage** and then either **Move Up** or **Move Down** from the group items sub-page actions bar.

### Adding service packages, repair times and service interval matrix actions
These actions are available in jobsheets, estimates, and vehicle inspection estimates. In contrast to the same actions in the document's header, these actions only update existing group items. If you want to add a group in a new line, you must use the actions available in the document's header.
1. Choose **Lookup** and then **Service Package**, **Repair Times** or **Service Interval Matrix** from the group items sub-page actions bar.

### Duplicate group, merge groups and create alternative actions
These actions are available in jobsheets, estimates, and vehicle inspection estimates and assist in duplicating or merging the selected groups as well as creating an alternative for the selected group. <br>
**Duplicating:**
1. From the groups items sub-page actions bar, select **Functions** and then **Duplicate Group**.

**Merging:**
The merging action can be used to merge two or more groups. The document lines from the merged groups are added to the newly formed group when the groups are merged.
1. Select one group to merge, then click on the vertically arranged dots after the first column and select **Select More** or press the **Ctrl** key and select the groups to merge with the mouse cursor.
2. Select **Functions** and then **Merge Groups** from the group items sub-page actions bar.

**Create Alternative:**
The **Create Alternative** action creates a new group that is identical to the selected group, which you can edit to make it cheaper, discounted, or otherwise. The group can now be published online alongside the selected group, with the option for the customer to choose. 
1. Select the group for which you want to create an alternative, then select **Functions**, then **Create Alternative** from the actions bar.

### Creating service package version action
This action is available in jobsheets, estimates, and vehicle inspection estimates and allows you to create a service package version from the selected group, making it easier to reuse the group as a service package.
1. From the group items sub-page actions bar, select **Functions** and then **Create Service Package Version**.

### Matching approved line groups action
If you change a group description or price after it has been published and the customer approves it, it is not automatically marked as authorised on the document. It generates an attention comment, which you can manually link to the current group in the document using **Match Approved Line Groups** action. This action is available in jobsheets, estimates, and vehicle inspection estimates.
1. From the group items sub-page actions bar, select **Functions**, followed by **Match Approved Line Groups**.

### Adding checklist attention lines
This action is available in vehicle inspection estimates and allows you to add vehicle inspection checklist lines as groups in the group items subpage.
1. From the group items sub-page actions bar, select **Functions**, followed by **Add Checklist Attention Lines**.
