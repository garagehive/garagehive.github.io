#   VHC (Vehicle Health Check) - Reminder Dates

Within the Vehicle Health Check, you have the ability to deferred any advisory work reported which has not been authorised by the customer. 

You can offer your customer a follow up call for the advised work. 

Once the date has been set within the Vehicle Health Check, 2 weeks prior to the agreed date it will appear in the tiles on the home screen.

#### How to set Reminder Date 

Within the Vehicle Health Check Lines section, there is a column for Reminder Date.

This is where you select a follow up date according to when you believe the work may be due. 

####    When the Reminder Date is coming up and or overdue 

2 weeks prior to the reminder date the items selected will appear in the VHC Reminder - Upcoming Tile. 

After the date has passed, if the work has not been authorised or reminder date removed, the reminders will fall into the VHC - Reminder Overdue Tile.

####    How to add the authorised work to a job from a follow up call. 

When selecting the relevant tile the work deferred will appear as several lines split up into labour and items. 

**Ensure you make a note of the VHC number as there may be multiple open for the vehicle.**

Highlight the relevant line which you are wanting to follow up. Then selected Related Information, followed by the Vehicle Health Check Card. This will open the original Vehicle Health Check and will show all work reported on that visit including any work previously authorised.
