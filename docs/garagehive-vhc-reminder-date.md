#   Vehicle Inspection Estimates (VIE) Reminder Dates

You have the option to defer any advisory work reported that has not been authorised by the customer within the vehicle inspection estimate. You can provide your customer with a follow-up call for the recommended work.

Once the date has been set within the vehicle inspection estimate, it will appear in the tiles on the home screen 2 weeks prior to the agreed date (this period can be specified by you and does not have to be 2 weeks).

### Knowing when the reminder date is coming up and or overdue 
When a reminder date is approaching or has passed, it is displayed in the **Role Centre** under the vehicle inspection estimates tiles named **Reminders Upcoming** and **Reminders Overdue**, respectively.

> **Example:**
>
> You could specify that 2 weeks before the reminder date, the items selected will appear in the VIE **Reminders Upcoming** tile, and after the reminder date has passed and the work has not been authorised or the reminder date has not been removed, the items selected will appear in the **Reminders Overdue** tile.
