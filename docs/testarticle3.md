title: Adding External Review Follow-up on Customer Surveys
---

Including an external review follow-up in a customer survey allows the garage to further engage customers who rate the business with a higher NPS score and are satisfied with the services to leave a review on your preferred external platform. At the end, you will increase your rating with better reviews.

3. Enter the **Min. NPS Question Value** in the **General** FastTab, under the **External Review Platform** section (if not visible, click **Show more**). If the customer rates the garage with this number or higher, a link to rate the garage appears at the end of the survey.
4. In the **Review Platform Name** field, enter the name of the review platform, such as **Google**, **Trustpilot**, or any other that you use to gain public ratings.
5. Finally, add the **Review Link** for the platform, which will redirect the customer to the review page if they click on it.
