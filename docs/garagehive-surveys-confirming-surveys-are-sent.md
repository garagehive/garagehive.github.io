#   Confirming Surveys are Sent

Surveys are sent to customers after posting a jobsheet. There are ways to confirm that the surveys are sent and that the customer has received and filled the survey.

## In this article
1. [Check the survey is on schedule to send](#check-the-survey-is-on-schedule-to-send)
2. [Check the survey has been sent to the customer](#check-the-survey-has-been-sent-to-the-customer)
3. [Check the survey has been opened and submitted by customer](#check-the-survey-has-been-opened-and-submitted-by-customer)


### Check the survey is on schedule to send
After posting a jobsheet, the system checks on the survey settings to send the survey. In this example, the survey we send is scheduled to be sent at 07:00hrs after 0days of jobsheet posting; that means if the invoice is sent today at 11:00hrs, the survey will be sent 07:00hrs tomorrow.

2. From the opened list, the time and date the survey is scheduled to send to the customer (in the posted jobsheet) are displayed at the end of the lines.
