#   Confirming Surveys are Sent

Surveys are sent to customers after posting a Jobsheet. There are ways to confirm that the surveys are sent and that the customer has received and filled the survey.

## In this article
1. [Check the Survey is on Schedule to Send](#check-the-survey-is-on-schedule-to-send)
2. [Check the Survey has Been Sent to the Customer](#check-the-survey-has-been-sent-to-the-customer)
3. [Check the Survey has Been Opened and Submitted by Customer](#check-the-survey-has-been-opened-and-submitted-by-customer)


### Check the Survey is on Schedule to Send
After posting a Jobsheet, the system checks on the survey settings to send the survey. In this example, the survey we send is scheduled to be sent at 19:30hrs after 1 day of Jobsheet posting; that means if the invoice is sent today at 11:00hrs, the survey will be sent 19:30hrs tomorrow.

3. Ensure the **Run Jobsheet Survey** entry has a status of **Ready**.
