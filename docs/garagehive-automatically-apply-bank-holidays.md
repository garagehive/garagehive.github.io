# Automatically Apply Bank Holidays to the Service Schedule
The **Bank Holiday Schedule Integration** allows you to automatically apply public holidays to the schedule. Once enabled, public holidays are greyed out in the schedule, making non-working days easy to identify. Based on the region specified in your Company Information, the system automatically applies Bank Holidays using the base calendar for that regionâ€”no manual input required. To setup:
