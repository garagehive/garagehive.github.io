3. Choose a **Ticket Type** for the attendee; it can be **Conference & Evening Event**, which allows access to both the **Day Conference** and the **Evening Event**, or **Evening Event Only**, which only allows access to the **Evening Event**. 

   > **Note:**
   > 
   > A company cannot order only **Evening Event Only** ticket(s); a company is required to at least order one **Conference & Evening Event** ticket type.

4. Add the **Email** for the attendee(s) in the **Email** field.
