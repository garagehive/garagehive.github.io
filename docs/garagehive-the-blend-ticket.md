## How to Order a Blend Ticket From the Garage Hive
If you are a Garage Hive customer, you can now order The Blend ticket(s) directly from the Garage Hive system. To order:

1. In the top-right corner, choose the search icon, enter **The Blend Ticket Order**, and select the related link.
2. Scroll down to the **Attendees** subpage and enter the **First Name** and **Last Name** of the attendee(s) in their respective field.
3. Choose a **Ticket Type** for the attendee; it can be **Conference & Party**, which allows access to both the **Day Conference** and the **Evening Event**, or **Party Only**, which only allows access to the **Evening Event**. 

   > **Note:**
   > 
   > A company cannot order only **Party Only** ticket(s); a company is required to at least order one **Conference & Party** ticket type.

4. Add the **Email** for the attendee(s) in the **Email** field.
5. When you've finished adding the list of attendees, double-check that all of the information you've entered is correct and select **Submit Order** in the actions bar.
6. If you made an error, need to add an attendee, or change the information you've entered, you can select **Edit/Cancel Order** from the actions bar. This cancels the previously submitted order, and you have to resubmit it when you finish editing.

   > **Note:**
   > 
   > The **Edit/Cancel** action will be available until July 29th, 2022, after which no submitted order can be modified or altered. The refund policy will be in effect, and any cancellation will be charged.

7. You have now successfully ordered your **The Blend 2022** ticket(s), and the ticket amount will be charged to your monthly bill for August 2022.

   > **Important:**
   > 
   > **The ticket submission period is open until September 9th, 2022.**
