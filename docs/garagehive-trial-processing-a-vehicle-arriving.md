# Processing a Vehicle Arriving in Your Trial

There are several things to do when the vehicle arrives for repairs, and that is what we look at here.

## In this article

1. [Checking in the vehicle](#checking-in-the-vehicle)
2. [Adding customer comment and allocating job to the technician on schedule](#adding-customer-comment-and-allocating-job-to-the-technician-on-schedule)

### Checking in the vehicle
When the customer arrives with the vehicle:
1. Open the jobsheet, fill in the **Arrival Date** and **Arrival Time** from the **General** FastTab and select **Vehicle On Site** to confirm the vehicle is on-site.
2. If the vehicle is staying overnight, select **Vehicle Staying Overnight**. 
3. If the customer has requested delivery date and time, add the **Requested Delivery Date** and **Requested Delivery Time** fields. 
4. Give the vehicle key a tag for easier tracking and add the tag number to the system.

### Adding customer comment and allocating job to the technician on schedule
To add customer comments:
1. Scroll down on the jobsheet page to the **Comment Section**, select **Customer** from the **Type Code** and add the customer comments; this helps the technicians understand what other issues the customer might have highlighted.
2. Now, you are ready to assign the job to a technician. Close the jobsheet page and go to the **Schedule**, left click and hold on the booking and drag it on the technician up to time you want to allocate. 
3. Release when in the correct position (see below).
