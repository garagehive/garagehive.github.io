# Accountancy Routines

The purpose of this document is to assist with your accountancy routines, if all the tasks in this document are routinely completed your accounts should be accurate. If you are unsure how to complete any of the tasks, please contact support. 

## Tips and recommendations

* Get used to using the search function (Alt+Q) instead of the menu to navigate around the accountancy system. 

* If a customer has paid via a bank transfer, we strongly recommend that you apply the payment only whilst performing a **Payment Reconciliation Journal** and to avoid applying the payment manually. This greatly reduces the chance of duplicating transactions on your bank account.

## Daily Routines

These tasks should ideally be completed daily and if possible, the reconciliation should be done on the same day. Some of these processes relate to the general use of the service side of Garage Hive. 

* Post Jobsheets (Retail customers)
* Post Jobsheets (Account customers with payment terms)
* Run the WIP report **(Reports -> End of Day -> Jobsheets - Work in Progress)** and make sure all the necessary Jobsheets are posted or deleted
* Post Parts Purchase Invoices 
* Items to return report checked **(Reports -> Additional -> Items to Return)** - [Video](https://youtu.be/EyVbV50EwaQ "Items to return"){:target="_blank"}

#### Daily Reconciliation

Your daily reconciliation is the most important aspect of your accountancy process. If your end of day process is strict and the reconciliation is accurate, the rest of your accountancy process will be a lot easier. 

We recommend having a separate folder for each day of the week. Each Posted purchase invoice should be placed in this folder during the day, this is also useful to separate the posted purchase invoices from those that still need posting. 

For an accurate daily reconciliation, the following must be complete:

* Reconcile End of Day Report **(Reports -> End of Day -> End of Day Report)**
    *   Reconcile customer receipts/refunds
        * Run PDQ/Card Receipt end of day
        * Check till float/cash receipts
    *   Reconcile Posted Purchase invoices
        * Check Vendor No, Document No, Document date & Amounts are correct on the End of Day Report

**If you have taken account payments and posted them, there is an additional report to run for the end of day reconciliation.** 

* Reconcile Customer Payments/Till (Reports -> Additional -> Customer Payments/Till)

At the end of each day, you should have the following in your "End of Day" folder for that day. 

*   End of Day Report
*   Customer Payment/Till Report (If required)
*   Posted Purchase Invoices (Posted that day)
*   PDQ End of day report
*   Card Receipts
*   Cash taken that day (If safe to do so)

This "End of Day" folder should then be passed to the person responsible for your bookkeeping / accounting to double check, then file.
