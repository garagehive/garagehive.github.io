# Reviewing Internal Surveys

To review the internal surveys after the employees have completed and submitted them:
1. From the role centre, there are two sections of surveys tiles available: customer surveys and internal surveys, both with **To Review** and **This Week** tiles.
2. After the internal surveys are completed and submitted, the **To Review** tile under **Internal Surveys** is populated.
3. Click on the **To Review** tile to see a list of the surveys that have been submitted.

4. Click on the **Answer Count** column cell for each line of the survey in the list to view the responses. If you marked the survey as **Anonymous**, the **Mobile Phone No.** and **Email** columns will have asterisks only to hide the user's identity.
5. After reading the answers click on **Edit List** from the actions bar, and mark the surveys **Reviewed** under the reviewed column.
