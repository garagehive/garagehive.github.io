# Reviewing Internal Surveys

To review the internal surveys after the respondents have completed and submitted them:
1. From the role centre, there is a group of tiles called **Internal Surveys** with **To Review** and **This Week** tiles.
2. After the internal surveys are completed and submitted, the **To Review** tile is populated with the list of the submitted surveys.
3. Click on the **To Review** tile to view the list of the submitted surveys.

4. If you marked the survey as **Anonymous**, the **Mobile Phone No.**, **Email** and **User ID** columns will have asterisks only to hide the user's identity.
5. Click on the **Answer Count** column cell for each line of the survey in the list to view the responses.
5. After reading the answers choose the surveys to review, and select **Mark as Reviewed** action from the menu bar.
