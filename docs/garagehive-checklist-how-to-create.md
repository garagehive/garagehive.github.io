Checklists offer the ability to create an inspection sheet/checklist for all areas of your business. For example, a vehicle inspection is a type of checklist.

Checklists have the following structure 

* Checklist Templates
    * Checklist Template Item Groups
        * Checklist Items

## Checklist Templates

A Checklist Template is considered the header of the Checklist, each Checklist Template must have at least one **Checklist Template Item Group**

## Checklist Items

**Checklist Items** are where you enter your checklist questions, a checklist item for example could be about "tyres" and could consist of a traffic light system and check boxes like the example below.

**Checklist Template Item Groups** can be linked to multiple **Checklist Template**, for example a **Tyre Checkist Item Group** could belong in the **Full Service Checklist Template** and the **Interim Service Checklist Template**. 

## How to create a checklist

From the home screen, click on the search icon in the top right hand corner

Type in the search box "Checklist Templates"

Start by creating a new Checklist Template, the Checklist Template will be the description of your checklist that you select from when deciding which checklist to complete as a technician. You will be linking Checklist Templates to your Checklist Template Item Groups using the "Linked Item Groups" action. Before you do this, you must create your Checklist Items

* **Caption** - The caption is what will appear on the line of the questions
* **Type** - Choose from either Line (a title) or Control (an entry)
* **SubType** - Select from what type of entry you want.
     * Radio Button
     * Textbox-Small
     * Textbox-Large
     * Checkbox
* **Default Value** You can populate a field with a default value to determine which radio button is pre-ticked
* **Attention If Has Value** Ticking this box will allow the Advisor to see from the list of checklists if any particular checklist requires attention. Any entry on a line with this ticked will flag a checklist.
