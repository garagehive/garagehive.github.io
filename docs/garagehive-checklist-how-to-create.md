Checklists have the following structure 

* Checklist
    * Questionnaire Templates (Header)
        * Question Groups (Questions belonging to a Questionnaire Template)

## Questionnaire Templates

A questionnaire template is considered the header of the checklist, each questionnaire template must have at least one **Linked Question Group**

## Question Groups

**Question Groups** are where you enter your checklist questions, a question group for example could be about "tyres" and could consist of a traffic light system and check boxes like the example below.
