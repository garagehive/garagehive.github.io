# Setting Up Primary Makes and Models

To set the condition for a particular primary make:
1. Click on **Related** from the menu bar and select **Make**. 
2. From the submenus that appear, select **Primary Make Conditions**. The primary make conditions help the system understand all the vehicle models under the selected primary make.

3. Edit the column **Begins With** to instruct the system to find all the vehicle models that begin with the defined condition. For example, if a vehicle model begins with BMW, it automatically falls under the primary make. 
4. **Vehicle Count** column indicates the number of vehicles that fall under the set condition.
