title: Setting Up Online Booking - Branches
---

## Branches 
Branches are the locations where customers can book their vehicles online. The customer will have to select which branch they are booking into, before they can proceed to book. Here is how to setup the branches:

In the **Online Booking Setup** page:
1. From the menu bar, choose **More Options**, then **Related**, and finally **Branches**. If More Options was previously selected, select **Related** right away; otherwise, **Fewer Options** will be available.

2. Rename the branch descriptions here the way you want them to appear in the online booking widget, and then enable the **Publish Online Booking** checkbox.

3. Add the **Online Booking (OB) Service Work Group Code** field for each branch.
4. Add the **Online Booking (OB) Available Hours Resource Group Code** field. This setting ensures that online bookings adhere to the service schedule available hours. When the available hours for a given day at a branch are used up, no further bookings will be allowed for that day.
