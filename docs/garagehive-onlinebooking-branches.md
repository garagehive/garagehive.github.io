title: Setting Up online booking "Branches"
---

## Branches 
Back in the **Online Booking Setup** page:
1. From the actions bar, choose **More Options**, then **Related**, and finally **Branches**. If More Options was previously selected, select **Related** right away; otherwise, **Fewer Options** will be available.
2. You should rename the branch descriptions here because they will appear in the online booking widget, and then enable the **Publish Online Booking** checkbox.

3. Then, click the down arrow to the right of the location code and then click **select from full list**.
4. Select the three dots at the top, then **Manage**, then **Edit**.
5. In the page that appears, ensure that the **Business Location** is enabled and enter the **Address**, **Phone Number**, and **Email Address** of that location.
