6. On this page, you can pay for the documents you want by checking the **"Payment Made"** box. If the value paid differs from the balance of the document, change it in the **"Amount received"** column. When the Payment made check box is selected on any document, the amount received will default to the full amount owed.

8. Before posting, you can review the Payment details on this final page. If you do not use the built-in accounting module, you will not see the **Lump Payment** option.
9. If you have an integrated card terminal and have chosen a card payment method, the **Lump Payment** option will be selected by default. This means that if you choose to post this Payment, the card terminal will be triggered and the entry will be posted if the Payment is successful.
