### Grouping document lines by creating a group and then adding the lines
The grouping feature is located above the **Lines** sub-page in a document and is referred to as **Group Items**. To form a group, do the following:
1. In the **Description** column, enter the name of the group.
2. Click on the cell under **Line Count** along the line where you have created a group.

### Grouping document lines from the checklist attention items
While working from a vehicle inspection estimate, there are issues identified in the vehicle which require urgent attention. From these issues, you can create groups to enable you add items and labour. 

> **Example**
>
> Suppose you have identified that the vehicle requires service, based on the mileage since the vehicle was last serviced. In that case, you can create a group under this heading (or rename the group to 'Full Servicing') and add servicing items and labour.


To create a group from the checklist attention items, first work on the checklist lines and identify the 'requires attention' lines. **Confirm** and **Create a VIE**.

Then carry out the following steps from VIE:
1. Select **Functions** from the **Group Items** sub-page actions bar.
2. Select **Add Checklist Attention Lines** to take the lines marked "requires attention" and create groups with the checklist line description.

3. Once the groups have been created, add the necessary items and labour to the document lines and match the lines with the pre-created groups.
4. Using the methods described above, match the lines to the groups.

1. Click **Look Up** and then select **Service Packages** from the document actions bar.
