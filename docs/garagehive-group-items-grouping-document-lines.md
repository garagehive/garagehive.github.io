# How to Group Document Lines
Grouping document lines is a feature available in the estimates, vehicle inspection estimates and jobsheets; this feature enables you to group the document lines under the same job or category. In this article, we will look at the various ways of grouping the lines.

### Grouping document lines by creating a group and then adding the lines
The grouping feature is located above the **Lines** sub-page in a document and is referred to as **Group Items**. To form a group, do the following:
1. In the **Description** column, enter the name of the group.
2. Click on the cell under **Line Count** along the line where you have created a group.

3. From the **Line Group Update** page, select the lines to add to the group (the group name column is at the end of the table with check boxes) and close the window.
4. The number of lines added to the group is displayed in the line count column.

### Creating group items from checklist attention lines
While working from a vehicle inspection estimate, there are issues identified in the vehicle which require urgent attention. From these issues, you can create groups to enable you add items and labour. 

> **Example**
>
> Suppose you have identified that the vehicle requires service, based on the mileage since the vehicle was last serviced. In that case, you can create a group under this heading (or rename the group to 'Full Servicing') and add servicing items and labour.


To create a group from the checklist attention items, first work on the checklist lines and identify the 'requires attention' lines. **Confirm** and **Create a VIE**.

Then carry out the following steps from VIE:
1. Select **Functions** from the **Group Items** sub-page menu bar.
2. Select **Add Checklist Attention Lines** to take the lines marked "requires attention" and create groups with the checklist line description.

3. Once the groups have been created, add the necessary items and labour to the document lines and match the lines with the pre-created groups.
4. Using the methods described above, match the lines to the groups.

### Creating groups by inserting service packages
To create a group from a service package:
1. Click **Look Up** and then select **Service Packages** from the document menu bar. The service packages available in the system can be fully priced or hold placeholder lines that you can edit based on your requirements, see [How to create service packages](garagehive-service-packages.html){:target="_blank"}.
2. Select the **Service Package** you want to add and click **OK**.
3. The service package is automatically added as a group.

3. The other option is to change the setting, so that all documents in future will have the **Custom Heading** as default. Search for **Sales & Receivables Setup** from the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, at the top-right corner.
4. In the **General** FastTab, select **Custom Grouping** option in the **Line Layout** Field. Press **Esc** to exit the page.
