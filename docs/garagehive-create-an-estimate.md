# Using the Estimate
An Estimate is used to provide a breakdown of the items and services to be provided to potential customers, including the quantity and prices. This helps in communicating with customers ahead of time and providing transparency in pricing and services provided.

### Creating an Estimate
To create a new Estimate:
1. Select **Estimates** in the Home Screen, and then choose **New.**

2. Select the **Service Type** - This is the type of job that you are quoting.
3. Fill in the **Vehicle Registration No.**:
    - If the vehicle is in the system, the customer card will be auto-filled.
    - If the vehicle is not in the system, the system will look it up using **VRM** to obtain the vehicle's details.
4. After the VRM lookup for the vehicle, enter the customer information:
    - If the customer's information was previously entered for another vehicle, the system will obtain the customer's information and link it to the vehicle.
    - If the customer is new to the system, the system will prompt you to [Create a new customer card](docs/garagehive-create-a-customer-card.html "Create Customer Card").

### Add Group Items
1. Under the **Group Items** section, you can create groups where you add lines based on job to be quoted. The groups help in the categorisation of the lines, for example you can create groups like **Full Service and MOT**, **Tyre Replacement** or other group items. Read more here [Grouping document lines](garagehive-group-items-grouping-document-lines.html){:target="_blank"}.

### Add Items and Labour
1. You can now begin adding **Labour** lines, **Items** lines, or **Service Packages** to the Estimate:
    - **Type** column - Select either **Labour** or **Item** as the line.
    - **No** column - Enter the number for **Labour** or **Item**, in the system. For example, for item, you can use a placeholder item number, such as **MISC** for items you currently don't have in stock, **inventory items** like air filters and engine oil, **non-inventory items** like consumables, or **external services**, or other items; for labour, you can choose **service labour**, **standard labour**, or other labours.
    - **Description** column - This is the item or labourÂ description that will appear in the customer's estimate.
    - **Quantity** column - Enter the quantity of items or hours to quote.
    - **Unit Cost** column - This is the cost of an item to the business. This field is left blank for labour.
    - **Unit Price** - This is the price at which the customer will buy the item or labour per unit.
    - **Unit Price (Calc) Incl. VAT** column - When you click on the amount in this field, a pop-up window will appear, showing the **Unit Price**, **Margin %**, **Unit Price Incl. VAT**, and **Total Incl. VAT**, allowing you to do price calculation.
    - **Line Discount %** column - If you'd like to apply a discount to the job, within this field, fill in the percentage discount.
    - **Line Discount Amount** column - This is the amount applied to the line as a discount. By default this column is not visible, but you can use [personalisation](garagehive-personalising-garage-hive.html){:target="_blank"} to add it.
    - **Line Amount Excl. VAT** - This is the pre-VAT total line amount.

### Converting the Estimate to a Jobsheet
You can either create a Jobsheet with all of the items from the Estimate added to it, which will close the Estimate, or you can select specific lines from the Estimate to add to an open Jobsheet if one already exists. 
To convert the whole Estimate into a Jobsheet:
1. In the menu bar, select **Home**, then click **Make Jobsheet**. This will convert your Estimate into a Jobsheet, which you can then use to [create an allocation for the job](garagehive-create-a-booking.html){:target="_blank"} in the schedule for the relevant day.
