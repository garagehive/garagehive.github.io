#####   Please follow the steps below on how to create an External Service. 

*   On the Jobsheet, within Lines, Select the type ***External Service***.

####   Unlike Parts, External Services can be invoiced out to a customer prior to receiving a purchase invoice. 

####    This is due to the fact you may not have received the invoice from the External Service Provider at the time you invoice the Jobsheet to the customer.
