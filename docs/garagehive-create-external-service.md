# Creating an External Service

If you are receiving a service from an external service provider and you want the charge to be passed on to your customer, you can charge this out by creating an **External Service**:

1. From the Jobsheet lines under column **Type**, select **Item** from the dropdown menu.
2. Click on the Tab button to move to the next column, **No.**. 
3. Click on the click on the ellipsis (...) at the end.
