# How to Manage GH Entitlements
GH Entitlements, in Garage Hive, are the services that a customer is entitled to use according to the licence that they have purchased or the role that a user has in the system. These entitlements define the specific features, functionalities, and access rights available to the customer or user. This helps optimise the user experience and ensure that customers can make the most of the services Garage Hive provides.
