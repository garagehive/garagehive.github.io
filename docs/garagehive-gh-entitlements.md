# How to Manage GH Entitlements
GH Entitlements, in Garage Hive, are the services that a customer is entitled to use according to the licence that they have purchased. These entitlements define the specific features, functionalities, and access rights available to the customer. GH Entitlements can be assigned to users, companies, or locations. The service will start working only after the GH Entitlement has been assigned to the respective entity.
