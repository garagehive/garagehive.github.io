# Garage Hive Extended Descriptions
In Garage Hive, an extended description is a feature used to provide a more in-depth understanding of a specific item, work or subject. They help users in adding more information about what they are working on. There are three types of **Extended Descriptions** in Garage Hive:

1. **Extended Descriptions** - This section highlights completed tasks and provides additional information for a card in Garage Hive, such as an item or a Service Package.
2. **OB (Online Booking) Extended Descriptions** - Primarily used for advertisements in an online booking, **OB Extended Descriptions** provide your customers with compelling reasons why they should book now in an online booking.
3. **Sales Extended Description** - Normally printed in VIEs and Estimates, **Sales Extended Descriptions** explain your findings as well as why certain actions are required for the quoted work.


Here's how Extended Descriptions appear in Garage Hive and how to use them:

1. All types of **Extended Descriptions** can be added to a **Service Package** card. To add them in a Service Package, go to the Role Centre and choose **Catalogues**, then **Service Packages**.

When finished, click **Close**.
