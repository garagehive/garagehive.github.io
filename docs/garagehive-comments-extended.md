### Adding Comments in a Document
To add a new comment in a document:
1. Open the document and scroll down to the **Comments** subpage. 
2. Select a **Type Code** or create your own custom **Type Code** with the following set-up:
   * **Description** - Specifies what will be printed on the invoice.
   * **Office Only** - Indicates whether the comment should be hidden from technicians.
   * **Print On Document** - Indicates whether the comment should be printed for the customer to see.
   * **Print Sequence** - This parameter specifies the order in which the comments are printed. Numbers are used to specify priority in ordering; the lower the number, the higher the priority in ordering, and vice versa.
   * **Print Placement** - Specifies whether the comment appears at the top or bottom of the invoice.

4. Here's an example of what printed comments look like; you can be as creative as you want with the description, positions, and orders.

### How to Use Extended Comments
**Comment (Extended)** is a function in Garage Hive that enables you to write comments which are longer and with more details. This function is available on all documents, can be printed in documents and has the possibility of hiding from the technicians.

Under the **Comments** subpage, clicking on the **Comment(extended)** field will open a pop-out window that can be made full screen and allows you to type as much text as you want. When you move your cursor over the **Comment (extended)** field, a pop-up preview of the full comment appears.

### Creating Standard Comments
You can also have standard comments that can be used multiple times. This helps to ensure consistency and makes it easier to remember what to write. Here's how to create a standard comment:
1. In the top-right corner, choose the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Service Comments Types**, and select the related link.

3. Enter the standard comment and click OK.

### Adding Predefined Jobsheet Comments
**Predefined Jobsheet Comments** can be added using **Service Types** or **Service Packages**, which means that when a Service Type or a Serviced Package is added to the Jobsheet, the predefined comments are automatically added in the **Comments** sub-page. To add predefined comments:
1. Search for **Service Types** in the top right corner ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, and select the related link.

3. Select the checkbox in the **Print on Document** or **Attention** column if you want it printed on the document or marked as **Attention**.
