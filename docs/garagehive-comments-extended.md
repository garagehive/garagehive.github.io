### Adding Comments in a Document
To add a new comment in a document:
1. Open the document and scroll down to the **Comments** subpage.

2. Select a **Type Code** or create your own custom **Type Code** with the following set-up:
   * **Description** - Specifies what will be printed on the invoice.
   * **Office Only** - Indicates whether the comment should be hidden from technicians.
   * **Print On Document** - Indicates whether the comment should be printed for the customer to see.
   * **Print Sequence** - This parameter specifies the order in which the comments are printed. Numbers are used to specify priority in ordering; the lower the number, the higher the priority in ordering, and vice versa.
   * **Print Placement** - Specifies whether the comment appears at the top or bottom of the invoice.

3. You can now add a comment to the document, by selecting the **Type Code** and adding the comment in the **Comment** field.
4. Here's an example of what printed comments look like; you can be as creative as you want with the description, positions, and orders.

### How to Use Extended Comments
**Comment (Extended)** is a function in Garage Hive that enables you to write comments which are longer and with more details. This function is available on all documents, can be printed in documents and has the possibility of hiding from the technicians.

1. Under the **Comments** subpage, click on the **Comment(extended)** field 

   ![](media/garagehive-comments02.png)

2. This opens a pop-out window that can be made full screen and allows you to type as much text as you want.

3. When you move your cursor over the **Comment (extended)** field, a pop-up preview of the full comment appears.

3. When adding the customer to a new Jobsheet, the comment(s) will now pop up before adding the customer, giving you the option to use the **Copy to Document** action to transfer the comment to the document.

### Adding Predefined Comments
**Predefined Comments** can be added using **Service Types** or **Service Packages**, which means that when a Service Type or a Service Package is added to the Jobsheet, Estimate or VIE, the predefined comments are automatically added in the **Comments** sub-page. To add predefined comments:
1. Search for **Service Types** in the top right corner ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, and select the related link.

   ![](media/garagehive-comments9.png)

2. Select the Service Type for which you want predefined comment(s), then scroll down to the **Predefined Comments** sub-page, select the comment **Type Code**, and enter the comment in the **Comment(Extended)** column.
3. Select the checkboxes on the right to have the comment added to **Jobsheets**, **Estimates**, or **VIEs**. At least one document, if not all, should be selected.
