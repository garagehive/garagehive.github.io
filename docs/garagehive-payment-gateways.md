## The Payment Gateways in Garage Hive
Payment gateway is a service that automates the payment transactions between the business and the customer from the Garage Hive system. Garage Hive has two payment gateways available:

### Payment by Garage Link
Garage Link (GLink) is a payment method in which the payment is processed online via a link generated for each transaction. The customer can open it and use it to pay online from wherever they are by clicking on this link.

### Payment by Card Terminal
A Card Terminal, also known as a point of sale (POS) terminal, is an electronic device that allows a business to accept credit card payments from customers. The card terminal is linked to the Garage Hive system, and the customer must physically present the credit card for payment.
