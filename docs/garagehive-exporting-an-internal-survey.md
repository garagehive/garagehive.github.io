# Exporting an Internal Survey

Exporting an internal survey is a feature available in surveys to help you in sharing internal surveys file for external use with the extension **stx**. For example, you could export a survey to share with an external consultant.

### To export an internal survey:
1. Search for **Surveys** at the top-right corner, and select it from the results. A list of previously created surveys is displayed.
2. Select the survey to export, and click on **Actions** and select **Export** from the actions bar.
3. The export action allows you export the survey file with the **stx** extension, then click **Yes**.

**2. As a repeat user:**
As a repeat user, you will have already activated the **Template** field, and all you need to do now is use the feature:
1. Locate and select the survey to be updated.

3. If you are exporting a survey and you want it during import to be created with the same number, make sure you mark it as a template, by selecting the **Template** field.
