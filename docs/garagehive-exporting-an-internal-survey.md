2. Select the survey to export, then click **Actions** and then **Export** from the actions bar. Click **Yes** to export. You can also export multiple surveys at once.

4. If you want the survey to be used as a template, which means the survey number will be preserved, make sure that the **Template** slider is on before exporting.
