#   Creating a Purchase Credit Memo when Parts have been shipped and credit note does not match Purchase Return Order.   

There are several ways in which to post a purchase return order after the parts have been shipped. 

Firstly, if the credit note matches the parts within the purchase return order, you can simply, Post, Ship and Invoice. 

Alternatively, if the parts shipped come back on two different credit notes, use the following steps: - 

*   From the home screen select the Purchase button within the *Ribbon*.
