# How to Combine Receipts on a Single Invoice in Garage Hive
In Garage Hive, you have the option to combine received items into a single invoice. This means that if you have received items from the same vendor/supplier in multiple purchase orders, you can combine them into a single purchase invoice.

Before you can create a combined purchase receipt, you must have filled in two or more purchase orders and posted them as received, but not invoiced. Learn more about how to receive items in purchase orders without invoicing [here](garagehive-create-a-purchase-order.html#receive-items-without-an-invoice).

To combine received items into a single invoice:
1. From the Role Centre/Home Screen, select **Purchasing** followed by **Purchase Invoices**.
