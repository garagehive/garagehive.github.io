Once your EPOS (electronic point of sale system) has been set up for integration, follow the steps below to enable integrated payments for your Dojo card machine:

- Tap the three bars at the top left of the screen on the card machine.
- Choose **Settings**, then **Integrated Payments**.
- Tap **Pay at Counter** or **Pay at Table**. To return to the **Settings** menu, use the back arrow.
- Select **Integrated Sale**.
- The card machine should now display a black Dojo screen, indicating that it is ready for integrated payments.

This will allow the card machine to integrate with your EPOS system.
