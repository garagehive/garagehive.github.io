### What are Resource Time Registration Entries
**Resource Time Registration Entries** is the table that contains all the information about your technicians' clocking activity. Our reporting software will use this table to assess your technicians' efficiency and attendance. The table stores the following records:

   * Work time entries
   * Idle allocations
   * Jobsheet allocations
   * Break time entries
   * Standard events, such as housekeeping

To find your resource time registration entries, choose the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Resource Time Reg. Entries**, and select the related link.

It is highly recommended to filter the columns by specific days and resources in order to view and modify the information. You can do this by right-clicking on the header of a column and selecting **filter**.
