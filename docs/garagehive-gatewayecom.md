# Payment Gateway Setup

To Setup Pay By Garage Link you first need access to your MMS from Payment Sense, they should email this to you. Once you have access you need to setup your Gateway Account Password for your ECOM account. You can access these settings under Account Admin.

Once your ECOM Password is setup, go to "Payment Gateway Setup" in Garage Hive, the support team should have already setup your location codes for you. All you need to do is select the location you want to setup.

On the setup page, the only information you need to enter is the Gateway Username and your Gateway Password. If you want to you can add an email address for payment notifications. 

Please note, your Gateway Username and Password isn't the same as the one you use to log into your PaymentSense MMS, it's the password you setup from within your MMS as per the first image. 

The support team will setup the rest, please don't touch any other setup.
