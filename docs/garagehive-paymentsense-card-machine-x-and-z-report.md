# Generating Paymentsense Card Machine End Of Day, X and Z Report
Garage Hive provides the following reports from the payments received for via the **Paymentsense Card Machine:**
 * **X Balance** - An X Balance report returns the current local session totals on the **Paymentsense Card Machine** without resetting them.
 * **Z Balance** - A Z Balance report returns the current local session totals on the **Paymentsense Card Machine** and resets them. Other than the reset of totals, a Z Balance report is the same as X Balance report.
 * **Banking** - A Banking report fetches the current banking totals from the bank and returns these totals. The banking totals are reset in line with banking times.
 * **End of Day** - An End of Day report performs a Z Balance report followed by a Banking report.
