# Creating a Purchase Order in Your Trial

To start communicating with the suppliers/vendors, you need to prepare the purchase orders, which indicate the items you need to buy. The purchase orders can be prepared directly from the purchase orders page or the Jobsheet. Letâ€™s look at the different methods.

### Creating a Purchase Order from a Document
To create a purchase order from a document (Jobsheet, Estimate or Vehicle Inspection Estimate):
1. Select the item lines you want to order by ticking on the box in column **Purchase(Special)**; this can be items that don't exist in the system where you have added a placeholder item **No.** such as **MISC** or items that exist in the system but are currently not in stock. Ticking this column selects the items and marks them to be added to the purchase order. 
2. Fill in the **Vendor No.** column to the right by selecting a supplier of your choice.
3. At the top of your document in the menu bar, click on **Parts**.
4. Select **Create Purchase Order(s)** from the submenus. A Purchase Order is created.

### Linking a Purchase Order with the Jobsheet
To link a Purchase order with a Jobsheet:
1. Scroll up to the **General** FastTab.
2. Fill in the **Jobsheet No.** field, or choose from the list. 
3. All the items in the purchase order will now be automatically added to the linked Jobsheet.
