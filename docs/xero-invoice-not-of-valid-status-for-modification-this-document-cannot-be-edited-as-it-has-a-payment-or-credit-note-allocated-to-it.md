#   Invoice not of valid status for modification This document cannot be edited as it has a payment or credit note allocated to it.  

This error is most commonly seen when an invoice is manually created Xero instead of allowing GH to create the invoice via the integration. 

To see what document this error relates to clicking on the “Source” code to the right of the error and the customer ledger entries page will load with the effected document highlighted.

To rectify this either remove the invoice from Xero and re-export the invoice from Garage Hive or select more options > functions > incoming document > external accountancy > mark as skipped.
