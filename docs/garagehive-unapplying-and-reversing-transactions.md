# Un-applying and Reversing Transactions
You may have applied a payment to the wrong invoice, made a payment to the wrong customer, completed the wrong transaction to a customer, and so on; in all of these cases, Garage Hive provides a way to have the transactions corrected or reversed.

### Un-applying Transactions
Un-applying payments means that you want to deallocate or unlink a transaction from a customer's invoice so that you can reallocate it to another one. To undo an applied transaction:
1. Select the customer's list from the role centre, and then select the customer to whom the transaction was incorrectly applied.

2. Select **Customer** and then **Ledger Entries** from the customer's card menu bar.

3. Select the payment that was incorrectly applied in the **Customer Ledger Entries** page, then go to the menu bar and select **Home**, and then select the **Unapply Entries** option from the split button dropdown menu under **Apply Entries**.

5. You can now re-apply the entry by selecting another customer's invoice.

### Reversing Transactions

{% include tip.html title="Note" text="You can only reverse entries that are posted from journals." %}

Reversing transactions means completely undoing the entry and removing it from the system. To completely reverse a transaction, use the following process:
1. Select the customer's list from the Role Centre, and then select the customer to whom the transaction is applied.

4. Select **Reverse** from the actions menu in the **Reverse Transaction Entries** pop-up window (you can also select **Reverse and Print** to print the transaction). The transaction has now been reversed successfully.
