#   Understanding the Schedule

{% include youtube.html id="JSHb-4I0PCY" %}

The schedule is a tool predominantly used to manage your workshop. 

Garage Hive works by allocating time, rather than jobsheets within the schedule. This allows you to load  time accurately.

>   *For example.* <br>
>   If you are booking in a gearbox repair job, you would not be doing all of the work in one go.<br>
>
>    Garage Hive allows you to make multiple allocations of one job, therefore being able to accurately load your day with jobs you will actually be working on, therefore your statistics of available hours will also be accurate. 

### Understanding the colours within the Garage Hive Schedule.

>   **(IN PROCESS**) - *Light Green*

A technician is currently working on this allocation, **DO NOT MOVE THIS ALLOCATION**. 

It is dynamic and will grow or shrink based on the technician's clockings for this allocation.

>**(FINISHED)** - *Purple* 

A technician has clocked onto this allocation and completed their part of this job, whether that be due to requiring additional authorisation or that it is fully completed. - **DO NOT MOVE THIS ALLOCATION**

>**(READY)** - *Green*

>(**ON HOLD**) - *Red* 

A paused allocation can be moved on the schedule during the same day for a technician to resume this job. 

If it gets to the end of the day and there are still paused allocations, deallocate these and make a new allocation for the next day.
