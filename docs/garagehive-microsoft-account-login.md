# Your First Sign In to Microsoft Account
In this article, you'll learn how to log in to your Microsoft account as a new user and how to enable the Authenticator app to add an extra layer of security to your account. As a new user, you will receive an email containing your **Email** address and **Temporary Password**. Once you have these details, you can proceed with the following steps:
1. Open the [Microsoft Office 365 Login Page](https://www.office.com/){:target="_blank"} and click on **Sign In** button. Enter your **Email** address, as sent and click on **Next** and then enter the **Temporary Password**. Click **Sign In**.
