# Autodata Seamless Integration in Garage Hive

**Autodata Seamless Integration**, which can be accessed from the Role Centre or via the Jobsheets, Estimates, and Vehicle Inspection Estimates, is a feature in Garage Hive that allows the user to directly access technical information for the vehicle from the **Autodata Website**, such as vehicle service, repair, and diagnostics. Here's how to access it:

1. From the Role Centre, select **Service** from the navigation menu followed by **Autodata Workshop Application**.

2. To access it from the document that you are working in as the **Service Advisor**, which may be an **Estimate**, **Jobsheet** or **Vehicle Inspection Estimate**, select **Lookup** from the menu bar, and then **Autodata Workshop Application**. This launches a new browser tab, and filters the vehicle details for the vehicle in the document that you are viewing.
3. You can now access all the vehicle's technical information on the **Autodata Website.**
