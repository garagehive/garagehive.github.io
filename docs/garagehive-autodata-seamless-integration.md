# Autodata Seamless Integration in Garage Hive

**Autodata Seamless Integration**, which can be accessed via the Jobsheets, Estimates, and Vehicle Inspection Estimates, is a feature in Garage Hive that allows the user to directly access technical information for the vehicle from the **Autodata Website**, such as vehicle service, repair, diagnostics, and so on. Here's how to access it:

1. From the document that you are working from, which may be an **Estimate**, **Jobsheet** or **Vehicle Inspection Estimate**, select **Lookup** from the actions bar, and then **Autodata Workshop Application**. This launches a new browser tab, and filters the vehicle details for the vehicle in the document that you are viewing.
2. You can now access all the vehicle's technical information on the **Autodata Website.**
