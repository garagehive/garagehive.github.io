# Using the Jobsheet 
There are various methods for creating a Jobsheet, as described [**here**](garagehive-jobsheet-create-from-various-places.html){:target="_blank"}. In this article we'll look at the standard way of using the Jobsheet. The Jobsheet typically includes information about the labour and items used during the repair or maintenance process of the vehicle, as well as any additional charges or discounts.

1. Select the **Service Type** - This is the type of job to do.
1. Fill in the **Vehicle Registration No.**:
    - If the vehicle is in the system, the vehicle information will be auto-filled.
    - If the vehicle is not in the system, the system will look it up using **VRM** to obtain the vehicle's details.
1. Enter the current vehicle mileage, in the **Mileage** field.
1. After the VRM lookup for the vehicle, enter the customer information:
    - If the customer's information was previously entered for another vehicle, the system will obtain the customer's information and link it to the vehicle.
    - If the customer is new to the system, the system will prompt you to [Create a new customer card](docs/garagehive-create-a-customer-card.html "Create Customer Card").
