1. Fill in the **Vehicle Registration No.**:
    - If the vehicle is in the system, the vehicle information will be auto-filled.

1. After the VRM lookup for the vehicle, enter the customer information:
    - If the customer's information was previously entered for another vehicle, the system will obtain the customer's information and link it to the vehicle.
    - If the customer is new to the system, the system will prompt you to [Create a new customer card](docs/garagehive-create-a-customer-card.html "Create Customer Card").
1.  Fill in **Address & Contact** FastTab in the **Customer** card:
    - Select **Lookup Address from Postcode**, enter the **Postcode**, click **OK**, and then select the appropriate address.
