# How to set up service package conditions in Garage Hive

Service package conditions allow you to filter package versions by a set of criteria; they are filtered in documents and online if you have the online booking module.

Currently, you can set the following conditions for service package versions:

* Make
* Model
* Vehicle Type
* Fuel Type
* Customer Category
* Transmission
* Engine Model Code 
* Primary Make
* Primary Model

To set the conditions for a service package
1. Select **Catalogues** from the navigation menu in the role centre and then **Service Packages**.

2. Choose the service package you want to give conditions and scroll down to the **Versions** sub-page. Click on **Manage** and select **Conditions**.

3. You can add various conditions to the **SP Version Conditions** page. In this case, we'll use **Primary Make**, **Primary Model**, **Fuel Type**, and **Customer Category**. Click on the first cell in the **Type** column and add these conditions.

4. Take note of the exclude check box on the right; sometimes, it's better to exclude an option rather than include all variants. A good example is excluding diesel, diesel/electric, and electric, which would result in a petrol version, as there are many more petrol and petrol/hybrids to list.

5. The **Location** condition, **Production Year** range, and **Engine Capacity** range are defined on the version lines.
