If the original purchase order was posted before the day you are cancelling the document you will get the following message. Select **Yes**.

Finally, you will see this message. This confirms the credit memo was posted successfully. You do not need to open this, however, you can if you wish.

If it was posted incorrectly, you simply now just need to create a new purchase order.
