# Data Migration to Garage Hive from Other Garage Management Systems
Data migration to Garage Hive is the process of transferring data from one garage management system to Garage Hive system. The purpose of data migration is to ensure that the data is accurate, consistent and compatible with the Garage Hive. This process can involve different types of data, such as customer records, vehicle history, inventory stock, invoices, etc.

> Please contact the **Garage Hive Support Team** for assistance with this process:
> * **Phone** - [**02031461163**](tel:02031461163)
> * **Email** - [**getonboard@garagehive.co.uk**](mailto:getonboard@garagehive.co.uk)

The steps for data migration from other garage management systems to Garage Hive may vary depending on the specific system and preferences of each garage. However, a general outline of the process is as follows:

1. **Request a data export from the other garage management system.** This may require contacting their support team or following their instructions on how to export data from their system. The data export should be in a format that can be easily imported into Garage Hive, such as CSV or Excel files.
   
2. **Review and clean up the data export.** This may involve checking for errors, duplicates, missing values, formatting issues, etc. It may also involve deleting or modifying any data that is not relevant or needed for Garage Hive.
   
3. **Import the data into Garage Hive.** This may require contacting Garage Hive support team for assistance. The import should allow mapping the fields and columns from the data export to the corresponding fields and columns in Garage Hive. It should also validate and verify the imported data for accuracy and completeness.

4. **Test and verify the imported data in Garage Hive.** This may involve checking if all the records are correctly transferred, if all the functions and features are working properly with the new data, if there are any discrepancies or issues with the imported data, etc.
   
5. **Make any necessary adjustments or corrections to the imported data in Garage Hive.** This may involve editing or deleting any records that are incorrect or incomplete, adding any missing information or details, updating any settings or preferences, etc.

   {% include tip.html title="Note" text="Data migration from one garage management system to Garage Hive can be a complex and time-consuming process that requires careful planning and execution. It is recommended to consult with both support teams before starting the process and during each step of it for guidance and troubleshooting." %}
