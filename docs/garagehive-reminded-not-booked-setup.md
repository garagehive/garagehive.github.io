# Setting up Reminders for "Reminded Not Booked" Notifications
The primary goal of sending reminders to customers is to prompt them to book the service they were notified about. However, in some cases, the customer may not book as expected and require further follow-up. This is where the **Reminded Not Booked** setup is useful. It creates notifications within the system to help you keep track of which customers need follow-up action regarding their booking.
