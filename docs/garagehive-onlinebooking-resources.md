# Setting Up Online Booking - Resources
Setting up the resources for online booking, helps in adding the time slots for the resources when they are available, ensuring that they are booked depending on their availability. Here is how to set the resources.

In the **Online Booking Setup** page:
1. From the menu bar, choose **Related**, followed by **Resources**.

2. Open each **Resource** that is part of the **Resource Groups** you created previously (MOT, all techs, etc).
3. Choose **Related** from the **Resource Card's** menu bar, then **Resource** and **Time Grids**.

4. In this section, enter the time slots for which you want that resource to be available for booking. For example, the MOT resource would normally be set to 45 minutes or one hour because the labour in the service package for MOTs is 0.75 or 1.0 depending on your setup.

5. If a resource only has a 1-hour time grid and someone tries to book an MOT at **0.75** and a service at **1.5** hours, the total amount of time required exceeds the time grid. As a result, all of the time grids for **Service**, **General Resources**, and so on are typically assigned **1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 hours.**
