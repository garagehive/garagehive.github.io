# How to Create a Purchase Invoice in Garage Hive
In this article, the first question to answer is why use a **Purchase Invoice** instead of a **Purchase Order**? The best answer to that question is that Purchase Invoices are used when the item being purchased does not need to be linked with a Jobsheet. 

For instance, if you require a workshop tool for use in your garage, you need to create a Purchase Invoice, so it can be posted directly to the relevant G/L Account. 

Purchase Invoices can also be used for any bills coming into the business, such as tyre Disposal Invoices, Utility Bills, etc.

To create a **Purchase Invoice:**
1. From the Role Centre/Home Screen, select **Purchasing** followed by **Purchase Invoices.**
