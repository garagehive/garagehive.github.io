# How to Create a Purchase Invoice in Garage Hive
In this article, we'll first address the question: why opt for a **Purchase Invoice** instead of a **Purchase Order**? The most straightforward reason is that Purchase Invoices are used when the purchased item doesn't need to be associated with a Jobsheet. 

For example, if you need to purchase a workshop tool for use in your garage, you'll create a Purchase Invoice, allowing it to be posted directly to the relevant General Ledger (G/L) Account. 

Purchase Invoices are also suitable for handling any incoming bills, such as tyre disposal invoices, utility bills, and similar expenses.

To create a **Purchase Invoice:**
1. From the Role Centre/Home Screen, select **Purchasing** followed by **Purchase Invoices.**

     - Item
     - Fixed Asset

   - **No.** - Input Part number/ G/L Account etc.
   - **Description/Comment** - Type what you will want to appear on the purchase invoice.

   - **Quantity** - Fill in quantity as per your supplier invoice.
   - **Unit of Measure Code** - Select relevant Unit of Measure.
   - **Direct Unit Cost Incl. VAT** - Insert cost to use including VAT (This can be changed not to include VAT within the Vendor Card).
