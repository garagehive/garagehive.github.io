{% include youtube.html id="cRcPX7F5AvU" %}

Purchase Invoices are used when you do not require the item which is being purchased to be linked with a jobsheet. 

i.e. A workshop tool, via a Purchase Invoice this can be posted directly to the relevant G/L Account.  

Also, Purchase Invoices can used for any bills coming into the business. 

i.e. Tyre Disposal Invoices, Utility Bills etc.
