# Scheduling Recurring Internal Surveys

Internal surveys can sometimes be sent as recurring surveys because the information being collected is needed after a certain period of time, which could be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly. The following is how to set up a recurring survey:
1. From the top-right corner search icon, search **Surveys** and select it from the results.
2. Choose the internal survey from which you want to create a recurring survey.

3. From the **General** FastTab, select the **Recurring** slider. This enables a new section in the survey setup called **Scheduling**.
4. From the **Scheduling** section, select the **Frequency** of the survey.
5. The starting date and time of sending out the survey will be automatically filled based on the frequency you select, but this is something you can customise for your survey.
