2. The pop-up menu gives you three options to choose from, select **Ship** as you wait for the supplier's credit memo; this means the items have been returned to the supplier, and now you are waiting for a credit memo from the supplier.

### Posting a Credit Memo from the Supplier
After receiving a credit memo from the supplier:
