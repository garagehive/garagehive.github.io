# Creating a Purchase Return Order in Your Trial

Purchase return orders are documents you use to monitor and maintain all your returns. They help you track items you ship back to the supplier and receive a credit memo when processed by the supplier.

### Creating a purchase return order
From the role centre, click on **Purchasing** and select **Purchase Return Orders**. Click on **+New** to create a new purchase return order. Enter the vendor details and the items to return (see below).

### Shipping the items to the supplier
When the purchase return order is created, the items must be returned to the supplier for a credit memo to be processed. Click **Posting** from the actions bar and select **Post** from the submenus. The pop-up menu gives you three options to choose from, select **Ship** as you wait for the supplier credit memo; this means the items have been returned to the supplier, and now you are waiting for a credit memo from the supplier (see below).

### Posting a credit memo from the supplier
After receiving a credit memo from the supplier, ensure that all the details on the credit memo match the purchase return order; the date, document number, and the amounts. Click on **Posting** from the actions bar and select **Post** from the submenus. Now select **Invoice** from the three options, which posts the purchase return order to update the relevant ledger accounts and balance the stock levels.
