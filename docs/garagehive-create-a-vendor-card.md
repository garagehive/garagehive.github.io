# How to Create a Vendor Card in Garage Hive 
In Garage Hive, a Vendor card is used to store all the relevant information about a vendor or supplier. This includes their name, address, phone number, email address, payment and invoicing details, and any other relevant information. You can easily create a Vendor card from the Role Centre or the Home Screen.

## Creating a Vendor Card From the Role Centre
1. From the Role Centre, select **Purchasing**, followed by **Vendors**.

3. A new Vendor card will now be created, and you can start adding details about the Vendor.

## Vendor Card Details Sections
The Vendor card is divided into several sub-categories, as listed below:

#### 1. General Information
In the **General** section, you can add or view general Vendor details, such as the **Name**, assigned **No.** in the system, **External System No.**, **Balance Due(LCY)**, whether they are **Blocked** or not, among other general information about the Vendor. Click on **Show More/less** in the top right of the **General** section, to reveal more fields or hide some of the fields.
