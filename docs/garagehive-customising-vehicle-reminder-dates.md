# Customising Vehicle Reminder Dates

Vehicle reminder dates can be customised in the Jobsheet and Vehicle Card. Here is how you can customise the dates from the **Service Labour List** page:

1. Select **Catalogues** and then **Labours** from the role centre **Navigation Menu**, or search for **Service Labour List** at the top-right corner search icon.
2. Choose the labour from the **Labour List** page to customise the date. In this case, we'll go with **Service Labour**.

3. In the **Service Labour** card, a field called **Default Period Date Formula** is under the **General** FastTab. Enter the number of days (D), months (M), or years (Y) after which the vehicle should have the **Service Labour** done. If your formula is a combination of days, months, or years, use a **+** in between, for example, **1Y+6M**. When this field is left blank, the default period is **1 Year**. Exit the **Service Labour** card by pressing the **Esc** key.

4. Open any jobsheet that has **Service Labour** allocated to it to update the **Service Due Date**. There will be a notification at the top of the jobsheet that **Vehicle Reminder Dates Needs Updating**; select **Action List** from the notification.

5. The **Update Vehicle Dates** page displays the **Old Date** column, which contains the current date, the **New Date** column, which is empty, and the **Action List** column, which includes the actions you can take to fill in the **New Date** column. Select **Add 1 Year and 6 Months** on the **Service Due Date** row to update it to the 1 year and 6 months customisation you made. **Close** the page and check the **Service Due Date** field to see if it has been updated.
