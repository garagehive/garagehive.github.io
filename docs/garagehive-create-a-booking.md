2. For a **Technician**, find the technician's name to allocate for on the left side and the time to allocate at the top. To begin the allocation, click on the row from the start time. Drag up to the time you want the allocation to finish without releasing the mouse.
3. Select the **Allocation Type** from the pop-up menu, which can be a **warranty job**, an **existing Jobsheet** or a **standard event**. Click **OK**.

4. For other resources, such as **MOT Bay**, choose the **Allocation Type** after creating the allocation by dragging along the row. Enter the **Vehicle Registration No.** and press the **Tab** key. 
5. If the vehicle is in the system, you will be notified that it is linked with a customer, and you will be able to apply allocation to the customer.

5. If the vehicle is not in the system, the system will find it using the VRM, and you will now need to provide the customer information in the **Customer** field. If the customer is already in the system, you can choose from the list; or else, create a new **Customer** card.
