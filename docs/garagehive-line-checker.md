# Understanding the Jobsheet Line Checker Notifications
The line checker is a column available in the Jobsheet **Lines** Sub-Page that provides notifications on the **Item** or **Labour** that has been added to the Jobsheet lines. This ensures that the user is aware of any errors, warnings, or information related to the added item or labour.

In this article, we will look at what they actually mean and the implications of posting the document:

### Line Checker in Technician Jobsheet
The **Technician Jobsheet** allows the technician to see notification about Item Unavailability as well as whether a substitute for the item exists. The following is how the notification appears and what the technician should do to view it:
1. If a line has a notification in the line checker, the icon appears in the **Show Document Lines** action, and when clicked, it displays the lines with the notification in italic and bold for the **Item No.**, as shown below.

2. When the technician selects the line with the italic and bold Item No., they will now see the icon notification on the **Check** field. The technician needs to click on the icon to find out what the notification is about.
