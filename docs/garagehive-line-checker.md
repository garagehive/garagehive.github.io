# Understanding the Jobsheet Line Checker Notifications
The line checker is a column available in the Jobsheet **Lines** FastTab that provides notifications on the **Item** or **Labour** that has been added to the Jobsheet lines. This ensures that the user is aware of any errors, warnings, or information related to the added line.
