# How to Remove Customer Ownership of a Vehicle from Garage Hive
When a vehicle changes ownership, the previous owner may still receive reminders about the vehicle, even if they are no longer the owner. There are two ways to remove the customer ownership of a vehicle.
1. [From the Vehicle Card](#removing-customer-ownership-from-the-vehicle-card)
2. [Customer Opt Out Link](#using-the-customer-opt-out-link-in-the-reminder-message)

## Removing Customer Ownership From the Vehicle Card
 Here's how to remove the ownership from the vehicle:

1. Open the **Vehicle Card** in which the the ownership of the vehicle has changed, by selecting it from the Vehicles list in the Role Centre.
