# Types of Customer Notifications in Garage Hive

In Garage Hive, customer notifications are system settings that allow the system to communicate specific information to the customer, such as MOT Reminders, Booking Reminders, Survey Notifications, and so on. These notifications enable the garage owner to engage the customer effectively while also keeping the customer up to date on important information. Let's look at the different customer notifications available in Garage Hive.
