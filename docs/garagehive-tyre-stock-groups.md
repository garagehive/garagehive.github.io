### Add Location Specific Setup to Tyre Stock Groups
Location Specific setup helps in the creation of the Tyre Stock Group for a specific location, meaning that it is only available in that location. To add **Location-Specific Setup**:
1. Open the **Tyre Stock Groups** page, select the **Tyre Stock Group** to which you want to add a location, and then select **Location-Specific Setup** from the menu bar.

2. Choose the location you want to have in the group. You can add one or more locations to the group. 
3. You could also specify the **Minimum Stock Quantity** for each location. When you're finished, close the page.

4. The other way to add the **Location** to a group is from the **Location-Specific Setup** column within the **Tyre Stock Groups** page. 
5. Select the group that you want to add a particular location, and click on the **Location-Specific Setup** column. If the page is not editable, make sure to click on **Edit List** to enable editing.

### Enable Tyre Stock Group Ordering in Requisition Worksheet
If you want the requisition worksheet to work with Tyre Stock Groups instead of individual tyre items when selecting items to order, you need to create tyre placeholder items and categorise all the tyre stock groups. Hereâ€™s how to do it:
1. In the top right corner, choose the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Tyre Stock Groups**, and select the related link.

   ![](media/garagehive-tyre-stock-placeholder1.png)

2. In the **Tyre Stock Placeholder Item** column, create new placeholder items for each category you have.

3. Make sure the item card is set up as a **Tyre** item template and marked as a **Placeholder Item**.

   ![](media/garagehive-tyre-stock-placeholder3.png)

4. After adding a **Tyre Stock Placeholder Item** for each category, go to the tyre item card and add the **Reordering Policy** as **Maximum Qty.** and the **Reorder Point** as point when to reorder.

   ![](media/garagehive-tyre-stock-placeholder4.png)

5.  In the **Tyre Fields** FastTab of the item card, ensure that the **Stock Category** is included.

   ![](media/garagehive-tyre-stock-placeholder5.png)

6. Next, click on the **Items to Order** tile.
