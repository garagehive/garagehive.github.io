{% include youtube.html id="Q7uRrSmHyMk" %}

Item price/Discount groups can be used to set up markups, pricing and discounts for specific items. 

Search for the related table "Item price groups" or "item discount groups." 

Create any groups required, give them a code and a description. You will see the number of items that belong to that group in the column on the far-right "item Count".
