### Using online documents in estimates
Let's say a customer phones the garage before bringing the vehicle in for repair, and the customer wants to know how much it will cost to do an **MOT** and a **Full Service**. The **Estimate** is the relevant document to use. There are no action categories in the online document for the Estimate; instead, all created group items are listed under the **Estimate** header, as shown below.

If a customer has authorised the work, you can use the **Make Jobsheet** action to create a new jobsheet for this work and schedule it in or add authorised work to existing jobsheet using the **Copy Authorised Lines to Jobsheet** action.

### Using online documents in checklists
When the customer brings the vehicle to the garage for pre-booked work, the garage can have a policy doing overall vehicle health check. In such a scenario, the **Checklist** should be created, which involves physically checking the vehicle, taking pictures of the faults, and adding technicians' comments. As a result of the inspection, a report is created and can be sent to the customer as a download via an online document.

After reviewing the checklist, the customer can **Request a Callback** if they have any questions or give the go-ahead to prepare a vehicle inspection estimate.

### Using online documents in vehicle inspection estimates
When a **Checklist** is carried out and there are some previously unknown faults found, to prepare an Estimate for the work needed to fix them 
the **Vehicle Inspection Estimate** is created.

To make it quick and efficient to price up the previously found issues there are multiple features that help this. The perfect scenario would be that the checklist lines are configured to flag as attention if a technician marks them as amber or red. When the line is marked as attention, technician is prompted to take a picture of the fault to later show it to customer. Also technician adds a text explaining the fault and it can be taken from templates. Text template has a service package linked to it that holds description on why this needs to done and the work items.

When vehicle inspection estimate is created, group items are generated with **Add Attention Lines** action. That brings all the faults from checklist to VIE **Group Items**, links checklist pictures to these groups, applies checklist text template packages with descriptions and lines. Then the lines can be priced up and item group descriptions edited according to the exact case.

When the vehicle inspection estimate is priced up it can be shared via an online document with various categories of the groups, such as advised, required, additional, and so on.

The customer can approve all of the items in a category or just some subitems. To copy the approved items in the online document to the jobsheet, use the **Copy Authorised Lines to Jobsheet** action under **Process** in the VIE actions bar.

### Using online documents in jobsheets
The customer has approved work, and you create a jobsheet for those items. While working on the car additional work can be found that needs to be done and for this you can just add that work to the same jobsheet and publish an online job authorization. This allows the customer to keep track of all approved items as well as any additional items that come up.
