# Using the FactBox in Garage Hive
A FactBox is an information area located on the right-hand side of a page which is represented by the icon ℹ️. The area is divided into several sections for displaying content such as links, attachments, other pages, and tiles. Typically, a FactBox is used to showcase information related to a particular item on the main content page. For instance, if you are viewing a list of vehicles, you can use a FactBox to view details of a selected vehicle in the list as shown below.

A FactBox can be found on the following page types:
- Card such as an item card.

1.  Open the page where you want to use the FactBox, such as a Customer Card or a Vehicle Card.
2.  Click on the FactBox icon (ℹ️), located at the top right corner of the content page.
