#   Reviewing Your Customer Surveys
All the surveys that the customers have submitted will need reviewing to ensure you are aware of the customer's thoughts about your business. Let us look at how to review the surveys.

### Checking Submitted Customer Surveys
After the customers have submitted surveys, they appear on the role centre page in the survey tiles: 
1. Survey tile **To Review** - for all the surveys that the service advisor is yet to review.
2. Survey tile **This Week** - for all the surveys submitted in the current week.

2. Click on the cells in column **Answers Count** on each survey to view what customers answered and any comments they have added.

### Categorising Submitted Customer Surveys
To categorise surveys into different groups, depending on the responses given: 
1. Click on **Edit List**, and select the column **Reason Code**.
2. Add a **Category** from the list or add a new one; in this example, we will mark one of the surveys submitted as requiring **Action**, so that there can be a follow-up with the customer.
