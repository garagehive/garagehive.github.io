Easy Clocking is where the technician will work for the majority of the time. The technician will use Easy Clocking for most of his daily tasks, such as:

   * Clocking in and out of work
   * Viewing their tasks for the day
   * Clocking on and off jobs
   * Clocking on and off breaks
   * Being able to view which job they are currently clocked on
   * Adding comments to jobs, with the ability to mark them for attention or print on document
