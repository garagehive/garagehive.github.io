On this last page, you can check the Payment details before posting. If you are not using the built-in accountancy module you won't see **"Lump Payment"** as an option.
If you have an integrated card terminal and have selected a card payment method, you will see this option selected by default. This means that when you choose to post this Payment the card terminal will be triggered and the entry posted upon successful Payment.
