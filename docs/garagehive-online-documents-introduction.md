# Online Documents Introduction 

The online documents feature in Garage Hive allows a garage owner to communicate with customers in real time and receive quick feedback on jobs that need to be done. The garage owner creates a report to share with customers via a link generated by the system. The link is sent to the customer via email or SMS, and they can open it on whatever device they are using.

The following articles are available to help you better understand the feature:
