#### How to Process a Vehicle Arriving
The following steps outline how to process an arriving vehicle that was pre-booked:

   |            |                                                                                                                                                                     |
   | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **Step 1** | Open the schedule to access the booking allocation.                                                                                                                 |
   | **Step 2** | Right-click on the allocation and select Lookup.                                                                                                                    |
   | **Step 3** | On the General FastTab, enable the Vehicle on Site slider to confirm that the vehicle has arrived.                                                                  |
   | **Step 4** | Allocate the key number for the vehicle in the Key Tag No. field.                                                                                                   |
   | **Step 5** | If the vehicle is staying overnight, enable the Vehicle Staying Overnight slider.                                                                                   |
   | **Step 6** | If there is a requested time and date to return the vehicle, enter the date in the Requested Delivery Date field and the time in the Requested Delivery Time field. |
   | **Step 7** | Scroll down to the Comments FastTab and add any customer comments.                                                                                                  |
   | **Step 8** | Ensure that the right items and labour are added in the Lines FastTab. Close the Jobsheet when done.                                                                |
   | **Step 8** | The Job will now be ready to allocate to a technician.                                                                                                              |
   |            |                                                                                                                                                                     |
