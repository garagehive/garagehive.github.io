#### How to Process a Vehicle Arriving
The following steps outline how to process an arriving vehicle that was pre-booked:

   |            |                                                                                                                                                                             |
   | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Step 1** | Open the schedule to access the booking allocation.                                                                                                                         |
   | **Step 2** | Right-click on the allocation and select **Lookup**.                                                                                                                        |
   | **Step 3** | On the **General** FastTab, enable the **Vehicle on Site** slider to confirm that the vehicle has arrived.                                                                  |
   | **Step 4** | Allocate the key number for the vehicle in the **Key Tag No.** field.                                                                                                       |
   | **Step 5** | If the vehicle is staying overnight, enable the **Vehicle Staying Overnight** slider.                                                                                       |
   | **Step 6** | If there is a requested time and date to return the vehicle, enter the date in the **Requested Delivery Date** field and the time in the **Requested Delivery Time** field. |
   | **Step 7** | Scroll down to the **Comments** FastTab and add any customer comments.                                                                                                      |
   | **Step 8** | Ensure that the right items and labour are added in the **Lines** FastTab. Close the Jobsheet when done.                                                                    |
   | **Step 8** | The Job will now be ready to allocate to a technician.                                                                                                                      |
   |            |                                                                                                                                                                             |

#### How to Process a Jobsheet to Invoice
The following steps outline how to process a Jobsheet to an Invoice:

   |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
   | :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Step 1** | Once the technician has completed the Job, the Jobsheet will appear in the **Allocation Complete** tile on the Role Centre and the tile will turn red. In the schedule, it is represented by a **purple** allocation.                                 |
   | **Step 2** | Click on the tile and open the completed Jobsheet from the list of **Jobsheets**. If the technician has added any comments, they will appear in the **Comments** FastTab.                                                                             |
   | **Step 3** | In the **Lines** FastTab, under the **Technician Confirmed** column, labour done by the technician and the fitted items will be shown. The technician's name will appear in the **Resources** column for the labour.                                  |
   | **Step 4** | If the **Check** column in the **Lines** FastTab has an emoji, it indicates that there is an issue that needs to be addressed. To view the issue, click on the emoji.                                                                                 |
   | **Step 5** | After addressing all the issues in the **Check** column, change the work status to **Ready for Collection** in the **Work Status Code** field under the **General** FastTab. This will move the Job to the **Jobsheets - Ready for Collection** tile. |
   | **Step 6** | Send an SMS or email to the customer to inform them that the vehicle is ready for collection. To do this, click on the ellipsis (...) in the **Mobile Phone No.** field, or the **Email** field under the **General** FastTab.                        |
   | **Step 7** | When the customer arrives to collect the vehicle, open the Jobsheet to take the payment. Select **Payments/Posting** in the menu bar, followed by **Take Payment**.                                                                                   |
   | **Step 8** | After taking the payment, select **Payments/Posting** again, followed by **Post and Print** to post the document and print a copy of the document for the customer.                                                                                   |
   |            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
