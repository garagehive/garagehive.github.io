#### Populating the Jobsheet Manually
There are several ways to populate a jobsheet. One way is to manually add the items and labour lines. To do this, select the first line cell on the Type column, select item or labour on the drop-down menu and press the tab button to move to the next cell. In the next cell, select the specific code used to identify the item or labour and add quantity and retail price (selling price)on the respective columns. The retail price can be updated manually or by use of the margin calculator (see below).

Note: To move between cells, you can press the tab button or use the front and back arrow.

#### Populating the Jobsheet using Service Packages
The second method to populate a jobsheet is through Service Packages. Click on Look Up at the top-level navigation bar, select service package and from the list that appears select a service package that applies to the vehicle on the jobsheet. The items and labour will be automatically added to the jobsheet.
