#### 2. Adding Items and Labour in the Jobsheet Manually
There are several ways to add the lines and labour in a jobsheet. One way is to do it manually. To do this, select the first line cell on the *Type column*, select item or labour on the drop-down menu and press the tab button to move to the next cell. In the next cell, select the specific code (*No.*) used to identify the item or labour and add the *Quantity* and *Retail Price* (selling price) on the respective columns. The retail price can be updated manually or by use of the margin calculator (see below).

> Note: To move between cells, you can press the tab button or use the front and back arrow.

#### Adding Items and Labour in the Jobsheet using Service Packages
The second method to add items and labour in a jobsheet is through service packages. Click on **Look Up** at the top-level navigation bar and select **Service Packages** on the submenus. From the list that appears select a service package that applies to the vehicle on the jobsheet. The items and labour will be automatically added to the jobsheet.

> Tip: You can pin the navigation menu on top.
