## How to Set Business Targets in Garage Hive
**Business Targets**, such as **Gross Profits**, assist the company in keeping track of the company's performance, ensuring continuous improvements, and always knowing how the company's progress is fairing at all times. Here's how to set **Business Targets:**
1. In the top right corner ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Business Targets** and select the related link.

2. To set the targets, select the **Location** code, then the **Type** as **Gross Profit**, followed by the **Date** and **Week Day**, which can be the first day of the week, today's date, or any other date as you will get to fill all the days in a calendar year.
3. Now, enter the **Amount** that you want to be your daily target.
4. Select **Export** from the actions bar after selecting all of the fields in the first line. The goal of exporting at this point is to make it easier to enter all of the other days in a year from an excel sheet.
5. In the pop-up window, select **Location** as entered on the first line, and **Type** as **Gross Profit**. Click **OK**.

6. This now exports the first line as an excel file. Open it and enter all of the **365** days in a year from the excel sheet. Edit the amounts for days where you want the targets to be different, such as Saturdays and Sundays.
