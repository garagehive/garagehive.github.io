## How to Set Business Targets in Garage Hive
**Business Targets**, such as **Gross Profits**, assist the company in keeping track of the company's performance, ensuring continuous improvements, and always knowing how the company's progress is fairing at all times. Here's how to set **Business Targets:**
1. In the top right corner ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Business Targets** and select the related link.

1. To set the targets, select the **Location** code, choose the **Type** from the available options, followed by the **Date** and **Week Day**, which can be the first day of the week, today's date, or any other date as you will get to fill all the days in a calendar year.
1. Now, enter the **Amount** that you want to be your daily target.
1. Repeat step **2** and **3** for all the available **Type** options using the same **Location** and **Date** but specific amount for each.

1. Select **Export** from the menu bar. The goal of exporting at this point is to make it easier to enter all of the other days in a year from an excel sheet.
