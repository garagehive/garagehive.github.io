# Using Parts Sales Order in Garage Hive
**Parts Sales Order** is the document in which you record your agreement with customers to sell parts on specific delivery and payment terms. Sales orders, as opposed to sales invoices, allow you to ship partially, deliver directly from your vendor to your customer, initiate inventory processing, and print various customer-facing documents. The **Sales Order** process integrates sales invoicing. Here's how to use the **Sales Order** in Garage Hive:
1. You can create a new **Sales Order** by selecting **Sales** from the navigation menu, followed by **Sales Order** in the **Parts Sales Admin** role centre, or by creating one from a [Sales Quote](garagehive-creating-sales-quote.html); select **Process** from the **Sales Quote** actions bar, followed by **Make Order**.
2. From the **Sales Order** list page, select **New** from the actions bar.

3. You can enter the **Service Type** or leave it blank, and then enter the customer's name in the **Customer Name** field (if the order is new and not created from a sales quote). 
4. Add the items for the parts ordered by the customer to the **Lines** sub-page.

5. Select **Print/Send** from the actions bar, followed by **Email Proforma Invoice** to send the order confirmation to the customer.

6. When the customer has paid for the parts, select **Posting** from the actions bar and then **Post**. You are given three options: **Ship** if the customer hasn't paid but you have sent the parts to the customer, **Invoice** if the customer has paid but you haven't sent the parts to the customer, and **Ship and Invoice** if the customer has paid and you have sent the parts to the customer. Choose the suitable one for you and click **OK**.
7. In the next window, select the method of payment from the customer and enter the amount in the **Amount** field to receive the payment. Click the **Close** button.
8. In the next prompt pop-up, confirm the posting date and click **Yes** to continue. The **Sales Order** has been posted successfully. To view the invoice, open it.

9. When a customer requests that the parts be fitted to the vehicle, you can generate a **Jobsheet** from the **Sales Order**. First, enter the vehicle registration number in the **Vehicle Registration No.** field under the **Service** FastTab.
10. Choose **Process** from the actions bar, followed by **Create Jobsheet**.
11. If you continue without entering a **Vehicle Registration No.**, the system will generate a dummy registration number that you can replace later.
