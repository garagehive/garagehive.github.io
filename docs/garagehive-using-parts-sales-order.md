# Using Parts Sales Order in Garage Hive
**Parts Sales Order** is the document in which you record the parts to sell to the customer at the agreed-upon cost and quantity. Sales orders, allow you to ship partially, deliver directly from your vendor to your customer, and initiate inventory processing. The **Sales Order** process integrates sales invoicing. 

Here's how to use the **Sales Order** in Garage Hive:
1. You can create a new **Sales Order** by selecting **Sales Orders** tile from the **Parts Sales Admin** role centre, or by creating one from a [Sales Quote](garagehive-creating-sales-quote.html); select **Process** from the **Sales Quote** actions bar, followed by **Make Order**.
2. From the **Sales Order** list page, select **New** from the actions bar.

3. Enter the customer's name in the **Customer Name** field (if the order is new and not created from a sales quote). 
4. Add the items for the parts ordered by the customer to the **Lines** sub-page.

5. Select **Print/Send** from the actions bar, followed by **Email Proforma Invoice** to send the order confirmation to the customer.

6. When you are ready to ship or invoice the order, select **Posting** from the actions bar and then **Post**. You are given three options: 
   * **Ship** - if the customer hasn't paid but you have sent the parts to the customer.
   * **Invoice** - can be used once the parts are shipped to create the sales invoice.
   * **Ship and Invoice** - if the customer has paid and you have sent the parts to the customer at the same time.
  
   Choose the suitable one for you and click **OK**.

7. In the next window, select the method of payment from the customer and enter the amount in the **Amount** field to receive the payment. Click the **Close** button.
8. In the next dialogue box, confirm the posting date and click **Yes** to continue. The **Sales Order** has been posted successfully. To view the invoice, open it.

9. If a customer requests that the parts be fitted to the vehicle, you can generate a **Jobsheet** from the **Sales Order**. Enter the vehicle registration number in the **Vehicle Registration No.** field under the **Service** FastTab.
10. Choose **Process** from the actions bar, followed by **Create Jobsheet**.
    
    > **Note:**
    > 
    > If you continue without entering a **Vehicle Registration No.**, the system will generate a dummy registration number that you can replace later.
