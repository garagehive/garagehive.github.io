# Adding External Review Follow-up on Customer Surveys
Including an external review follow-up in a customer survey allows the garage to further engage customers who rate the business with a higher NPS score and are satisfied with the services to leave a review on your preferred external platform. At the end, you will increase your rating with better reviews.

2. Scroll down to the **External Review Platform** FastTab.
3. Enter the **Min. NPS Question Value**, which means that if the customer reviews the garage with this number or higher, a link to review the garage appears at the end of the survey.
4. In the **Review Platform Name** field, enter the name of the review platform, such as **Google**, **Trustpilot**, or any other that you use to gain public ratings.
5. Finally, add the **Review Link** for the platform, which will redirect the customer to the review page if they click on it.

### External Review Follow Up Setup for Multi Location
1. When you have multiple locations for your business and need a different review platform and link for each, follow the steps above for setting up a single location, but the only field that is required is the **Min. NPS Question Value**. You can leave the **Review Platform Name** and **Review Link** fields blank.
2. Choose the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Locations**, and select the related link.
