# Setting up an external HR Consultant Survey to Answer

At times, the external HR consultant for your company may ask you, the business owner, to fill out a survey with questions that will help them advise you better on HR issues. To conduct this external HR consultant survey, follow these steps:
1. Import the **stx** file format that the consultant shared with you.
2. In the **Participant User Account** field under the **Participant Settings** section, add your user account as a participant.
