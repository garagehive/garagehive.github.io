# Items to Return Report 
The Items to Return Report helps you monitor what parts you have in stock based on the following criteria:
- The item is not in a jobsheet
- The item is not on a Purchase Return Order
- The item doesnâ€™t have any reorder policy

This report regularly ensures that parts are returned and not lost or thrown away, resulting in reduced loss of revenue.

1. From the home screen actions bar, click on **Reports**
2. Select **Additional** and from the list of the submenus, select **Items to Return** to open the report.
