# Items to Return Report 
The Items to Return Report allows you to keep track of which parts are in stock and need to be returned based on the criteria listed below:
- The item is not in a jobsheet
- The item is not on a Purchase Return Order
- The item doesnâ€™t have any reorder policy

This report regularly ensures that parts are returned and not lost or thrown away, resulting in reduced loss of revenue. To open the report:

1. From the home screen actions bar, click on **Reports**.
2. Select **Additional** and from the list of the submenus, select **Items to Return** to open the report.

    {% include tip.html title="Note" text="Based on the criteria stated above, the report opens a list of suggested items that you shouldn't have in stock." %}

3. You can now select the items to return by adding the quantity in **Qty. For Return** column and the respective **Vendor No.** or **Vendor Name** column.
