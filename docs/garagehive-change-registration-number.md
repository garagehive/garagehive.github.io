# How to Change a Customer's Vehicle Registration Number in Garage Hive
There are a couple of scenarios in which you may need to change a vehicle's registration number. Here are a few examples:

1. [When a customer changes the vehicle's original registration number and there is history attached to it in Garage Hive (Adding/Removing a private plate); when the history needs to remain with this vehicle](#vehicle-changes-to-a-different-registration-number).
2. [A customer who has a new vehicle but would like to transfer the registration number from another vehicle (Transferring a private plate)](#transfer-a-registration-number-from-one-vehicle-to-a-new-vehicle). 

In this article, we will look through both scenarios so that you can keep your records accurate.
