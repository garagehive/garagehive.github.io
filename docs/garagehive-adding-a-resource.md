# Adding a Resource (Person or Machine) in Garage Hive
In Garage Hive, resources can be set up to be either a person or a machine, for example, technicians for a person resource and courtesy car for a machine resource, and so on. Here's how to add a resource to Garage Hive:
1. In the top-right corner, choose the search icon, enter **Resources**, and choose the related link.
2. From the **Resources** page, select **New** from the actions bar, followed by **+New**.

3. In the **General** FastTab, enter the number of the resource in the **No.** field; you can enter a short form of the resource, and then enter the full name of the resource in the **Name** field.
4. Select the **Type** field as either **Person** or **Machine**, and then scroll down to **Resource Subtype** and select the type of resource that you are adding; this could be a **Tech**, **MOT Bay**, **General Ramp**, **Admin Staff**, **Tech Apprentice**, or **Courtesy Vehicle**. In this case, we'll use **Courtesy Vehicle**, which is a machine.
