## Moving to the Cloud - What to Expect
As part of our transition to the cloud, your access to Garage Hive will be changing. Currently, you log in using:

   * ðŸ”— **Current Login:** https://yourgarage.garagehive.co.uk/BC45

After the migration, you will access Garage Hive via:

   * ðŸ”— **New Login:** https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/
      
         OR

   * ðŸ”— **Simplified Login:** garagehive.co.uk/login (if you prefer a simpler option)


### Key Changes & Actions Required
1. **Reconnecting Power BI & Email Settings:** Your PowerBI, email settings will need to be reconnected - The day of your migration we will assist you in reconnecting these. 
2. **New Usernames & Passwords:** Your user names and passwords will change - We will provide new login details and assist with logging in closer to migration.
3. **Loss of Personalized Page Layouts:** Any personalized page layouts in Garage Hive will be lost.
4. **IT Access Required for Migration:** We will need you or your IT department to grant some access for us to perform the migration.

We will keep you updated throughout the process and ensure a smooth transition. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out.
