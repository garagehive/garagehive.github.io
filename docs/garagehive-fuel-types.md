# Adding Fuel Type Group Code
Fuel Type Groups is a feature in Garage Hive that enables you to classify vehicle engines according to their fuel type. By identifying these various fuel types, you can determine which vehicles are the garage's most frequent visitors, as well as gain insights into the evolving fuel trends that customers are embracing through the reports.

To edit the **Fuel Type Groups**:
1. Search for **Fuel Type Groups** in the top right corner ![](media/search_icon.png) icon and select the related result.
