# How to Use the Timing Belt Intervals Feature
Depending on the make and model of the vehicle, the timing belt should be replaced at a specific interval. It is critical that you keep the vehicle owner informed at the appropriate time. There are two ways to check the vehicle timing belt interval, which is pulled from the autodata, in Garage Hive.

## In this article

1. [Checking Timing Belt Interval From the Actions Bar](#checking-timing-belt-interval-from-the-actions-bar)
2. [Checking Timing Belt Interval From the Vehicle Reminder Dates Section](#checking-timing-belt-interval-from-the-vehicle-reminder-dates-section)

3. The following information is displayed in the pop-up information box:
   * **Timing belt interval in Miles or Months** - This is based on the manufacturer's specifications, which were obtained from the **Autodata**.
   * **Current mileage of the vehicle (miles)** - The mileage on the vehicle at the time of booking, as indicated on the document.
   * **Current age of the vehicle (months)** - The age of the vehicle at the time of booking.

   * **Next recommended timing belt change date (in miles)** - Based on the manufacturer's recommended timing belt change interval in miles. 
   * **Next Suggested Timing Belt Change Date (in Months)** - Based on the manufacturer's recommended timing belt change interval in months.
