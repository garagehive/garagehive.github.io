# Creating a Purchase Order

To start communicating with the suppliers/vendors, you need to prepare the purchase orders, which indicate the items you require. The purchase orders can be prepared directly from the purchase order page or the jobsheet. Letâ€™s look at the different methods.

### Creating the purchase order from the purchase order page
From the navigation menu on the role centre, click on **Purchasing** to access the submenus and select **Purchase Orders**. The purchase orders page opens; click on **+New** to create a new purchase order and enter the vendor details from the **General** fast tab (see below).

After adding the vendor details, add the item(s) to order at the purchase order **Lines**, specifying the item **No.**, **Quantity** and **Description**. For the non-stock items, you can use **Misc** for the item **No.** (See Below).

### Linking a purchase order with the jobsheet
To assign the items received to a jobsheet, from the **General** fast tab, fill in the **Jobsheet No.** or choose from the list. After linking with the jobsheet, it ensures that the items won't be signed out to another jobsheet since they are already in one.

> **Note**
> 
> You can only link a purchase order to a jobsheet once you receive the supplier invoice.

### Creating a purchase order from the jobsheet
To create a purchase order from the jobsheet, select the item line you want to order, tick on the box in column **Purchase(Special)**; this selects the items you want to order and to add in the purchase order. Add the vendor to order from on the **Vendor No.** column. Click on **Parts** from the action bar, select **Create Purchase Order(s)** from the submenu, and a purchase order is created (see below).
