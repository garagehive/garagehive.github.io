## Vehicle Card
A vehicle card is a valuable tool in Garage Hive, used to store and organize information about a specific vehicle. The information on the card is typically composed of a combination of data obtained through a VRM (Vehicle Registration Mark) lookup, as well as manual input. This information is organized into several sub-headings to make it easy to find and reference. 

The vehicle card is typically only created within the context of a Jobsheet or booking, and is not typically created outside of this context.
You can open a vehicle card by selecting **Vehicles** from the home screen and then selecting the vehicle card to open from the vehicle list.

## Adding a Default Location Code to Vehicle Card
When you set the default location code for a vehicle card, it allows for location-specific reminders to be sent. This means that every vehicle that is added to a Jobsheet, Estimate, or Vehicle Inspection Estimate will be assigned a vehicle location code. To enable this feature, follow the steps below:
1. In the top-right corner, choose the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Service Mgt. Setup GH** and select the related link.

   ![](media/garagehive-vehicle-card13.png)

2. In the **General** FastTab, scroll down to the **Assign Vehicle Location Code** field and enable the slider.

   ![](media/garagehive-vehicle-card14.png)

3. Once the slider is enabled, the system will update all your vehicle cards to reflect the location code from the last service document. This might take time, so it is recommended to do it outside working hours. You have the option to proceed with the update by selecting **Yes**, or simply enable the slider without updating by choosing **No**.
