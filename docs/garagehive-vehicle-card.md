## Vehicle Card 
A vehicle card is a valuable tool in Garage Hive, used to store and organize information about a specific vehicle. The information on the card is typically composed of a combination of data obtained through a VRM (Vehicle Registration Mark) lookup, as well as manual input. This information is organized into several sub-headings to make it easy to find and reference. The vehicle card is typically only created within the context of a Jobsheet or booking, and is not typically created outside of this context.
You can open a vehicle card by selecting **Vehicles** from the home screen and then selecting the vehicle card to open from the vehicle list.
