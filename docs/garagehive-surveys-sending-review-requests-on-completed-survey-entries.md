# Sending Review Requests on Completed Survey Entries
If you want to ask for review requests for your website or google page, you can do that with the customers who have already submitted their surveys:
1. In the top right corner, choose the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Customer Surveys Entries**, and select the related link.

3. Add a message to send, or **Apply Text Template** to choose from the available template (it's recommended you add a text template to make the process faster).
4. After adding a text to send, click on send, and the system will queue the SMS for sending.
