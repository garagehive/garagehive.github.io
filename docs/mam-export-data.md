#   How to extract the required data for Garage Hive

You will need to contact MAM Software directly for them to perform the data extract for you, simply inform them that you need the data required to import into another Garage Management System and they will send you a file to forward to us.

They will ask if you want a CD, We recommend asking them to log into your computer and leaving the file on your desktop instead.

We often notice that the reminder file provided during the standard export only contains expired dates, please ask them to ensure the reminders file is accurate.
