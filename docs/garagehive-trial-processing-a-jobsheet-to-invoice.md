### Posting a Jobsheet and Creating an Invoice
After receiving the payment, the next step is to post the Jobsheet:
1. Confirm that all the details in the Jobsheet are correct; the dates, amount, items signed out and customer details.
2. The posting date should be today's date (the day you are posting).
3. Then from the menu bar, select **Payment/Posting**, then you can select either of the following options:
  * **Post** - Post/invoice this Jobsheet without the option of printing or emailing it.
  * **Post and Print** - Post/invoice this Jobsheet and print a copy of the invoice.
  * **Post and Email** - Post/invoice this Jobsheet and email a copy of the invoice to the **Bill-To Customer**.
