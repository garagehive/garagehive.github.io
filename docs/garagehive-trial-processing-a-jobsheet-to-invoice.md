# Processing a Jobsheet to Invoice in Your Trial

When a jobsheet is done, all the information is correct, and all the work is done, it's time to make the jobsheet an invoice to share with the customer. In this article, we learn about how to turn a jobsheet into an invoice.

### Mark the jobsheet ready for collection
When the work on the vehicle is finished:
1. Confirm that everything in the jobsheet lines is ticked by the technician on the **Technician Confirmed** column. 
2. Mark the jobsheet ready for collection by selecting the field **Work Status Code**.
3. Enter the **Ready for Collection** status from the options; this moves the jobsheet to **Ready for Collection** tile.

### Posting a jobsheet and creating an invoice
After receiving the payment, the next step is to post the jobsheet:

2. The posting date should be today's date (the day you are posting).
3. Click on **Payments/Posting** from the actions bar and select **Post and Print**. The invoice is downloaded and ready to print.
