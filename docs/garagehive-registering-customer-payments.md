# Registering Customer Payments in Garage Hive
Other than using the **Cash Receipt Journal**, there is another method to receive payments in Garage Hive:
1. Select the customer you want to receive the payment from the **Customer List**.
2. Select **Process**, then **Take Payment**, from the menu bar.
3. Enter the **Payment Method Code** for the customer, and click **Next**.

4. If the **Apply to Documents** slider is enabled, select the document by clicking on the amount in the **Amount** field. If you disable the **Apply to Documents** slider, enter the amount in the **Amount** field and click **Next**.
5. Before posting, double-check the details, and either choose to **Print** or **Email** the receipt in the **Receipt** field.
6. Select **Post** to complete the payment if all details are correct.
