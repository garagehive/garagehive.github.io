# Searching for Vehicle, Checking Servicing Intervals and Adding Repair Times Using Engine Code

If you need to add specific servicing intervals and repair times in a Jobsheet using the vehicle's engine code, you can check the details from the Jobsheet using the engine code.

## In this article
1. [Auto Selection of the Vehicle](#auto-selection-of-the-vehicle)
2. [Manual Selection of the Vehicle](#manual-selection-of-the-vehicle)

### Auto Selection of the Vehicle
To view and add the data: 
1. Select **Actions** from the menu bar(if not visible click on **More Options**), then **Lookup** from the submenus, and then click on **Search Vehicle By Engine Code (Autodata)**, **Service Schedules by Engine Code** for servicing intervals or **Repair Times by Engine Code** for repair times, depending on what you're looking for.

2. When the pop-up window opens, confirm the vehicle details by clicking **Yes**. If the details don't match, click **No** and select the correct vehicle.

3. Choose the **Make** and **Model** of the vehicle from Autodata, followed by the **Engine Code** and the **Repair Categories** for repair times or **Maintenance** for service schedules. We'll use repair times in this case.

### Manual Selection of the Vehicle
Manual selection can be used to get data from Autodata for any vehicle and is not specific to any market. To view and add the data using manual selection:
1. If the vehicle registration is not automatically detected, a pop-up window will appear. Select **Other** and then click **OK** to choose the vehicle make and model from Autodata.
