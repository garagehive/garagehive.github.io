### Garage Industry Trends
[Garage Industry Trends](https://www.garageindustrytrends.com/){:target="_blank"} is an opt-in service for garages in various parts of the United Kingdom in which they agree to share their business performance data anonymously on a regular basis in order for everyone to be aware of industry trends. It combines four key performance indicators (KPIs), namely:
   * **Average Invoice Value**
   * **Labour Rate**
   * **Count of Future Bookings**
   * **NPS**

Any Garage Hive customer can opt-in to the service and share their data anonymously, as the more garages that participate, the more accurate the industry averages will be.
