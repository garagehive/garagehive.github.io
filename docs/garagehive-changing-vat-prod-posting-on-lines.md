# Changing VAT Prod. Posting on Lines
When you have items with different VAT requirements, you can change the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** to apply the appropriate VAT requirement. Here's how:
1. When you create a **Purchase Invoice** for the items you have received, use the [personalisation feature](garagehive-personalising-garage-hive.html) to add the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** column under the **Lines** FastTab.

2. Add the **Item** that has a different VAT requirement than the **Standard** one, as well as its **Qty** and **Price**.
3. Scroll across the columns to the newly added column of **VAT Prod. Posting Group** and change the **VAT** to the required one. In this case, we'll change it from **Standard** to **NoVAT**.

4. You can now add the remaining items (if any) and post the **Purchase Invoice**.

> **Note:**
>
> The same procedure as above can be used to change the **VAT Prod. Posting Group** on an **Estimate**, **Vehicle Inspection Estimate**, and a **Jobsheet**.
