# Creating a New Jobsheet From Various Places in Garage Hive

A Jobsheet can be created from various places in Garage Hive:

1. [From a VIE](#creating-jobsheet-from-vehicle-inspection-estimate)
2. [From an Estimate](#creating-a-jobsheet-from-an-estimate)
3. [From the schedule](#creating-a-jobsheet-from-the-schedule)
4. [Online booking](#creating-a-jobsheet-from-online-booking)

Let's look at how to make a Jobsheet from the places listed above:

### Creating Jobsheet from Vehicle Inspection Estimate
When creating a VIE for a customer, the **Customer Authorised** lines can be used to generate a Jobsheet. This makes it simpler to convert an estimate directly into a Jobsheet. To make a Jobsheet from a VIE:
1. Select **Process** and then **Copy Authorized Lines to Jobsheet** from the actions bar. You have the option of creating a new Jobsheet or selecting an existing one.

### Creating a Jobsheet from an Estimate
When a customer requests a quotation prior to bringing the vehicle on site, the quotation you create can be converted to a jobsheet once the customer approves and brings the vehicle on site.
1. From the estimate, click **Process**, and then select **Copy Authorised Lines to Jobsheet** or **Make Jobsheet** to generate a jobsheet.

### Creating a Jobsheet from the Schedule
When making a booking directly to the schedule, you can also create a jobsheet from there:
1. Open the **Schedule** and choose the **Start Date** for the booking.

2. Click and drag along the bay or technician to make a booking, then select an allocation and click **OK** to create a Jobsheet. Enter the vehicle and customer details. You can also choose an existing jobsheet.

### Creating a Jobsheet from Online Booking
When customers book online, the bookings are directly reflected in the system from the role centre, where a Jobsheet can be created.
