# Emojis for the Customer's Actions in the Attention Tile
When a customer takes action in response to the online document authorisation or payment links sent, the action is reflected in the Comments **Attention Tile** in the Role Centre.

This feature allows you to review each action taken by the customer individually with the assistance of emojis. Here's a quick look at how these actions appear with emojis:

Let's take a quick look on what each emoji means:

1. ✅ - This means that the online job has been approved by the customer.
2. 💷✅ - This means that the payment authorisation has been approved and payment received.
3. 📞 - This means that the customer has requested a call back in the online document sent.
4. 🔎 - This means that the customer has viewed the online document.
5. 💷❌ - This means that the payment authorisation has failed.
6. 🏦 - This means that the customer has requested a payment finance plan.
