# How to perform a Vehicle Inspection Checklist as a Technician
To perform a Vehicle Inspection Checklist, you can either start a new one or open an existing checklist that has been pre-assigned to a Jobsheet by the Service Advisor.

### Opening a New or Existing Vehicle Inspection Checklist
1. From the Jobsheet menu (three dots), select **Vehicle Inspections** to open existing ones.
2. If there is already an inspection attached to the Jobsheet, it will automatically open. If not, the system will prompt you to create a new checklist.
3. Select **Yes** to create a new inspection. You will be prompted to choose from a list of predefined vehicle inspections. Select the appropriate inspection and press **OK.**
4. You can also create a new one directly by selecting **Create Vehicle Inspection** from the menu.
