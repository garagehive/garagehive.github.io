{% include youtube.html id="BBjOZrxbzPs" %}



A Vehicle Inspection Checklist can either be pre-assigned to a jobsheet by a Service Advisor, or it can be created by a Technician. To create a new inspection or open an existing inspection, open the menu from the jobsheet and select "Show Vehicle Inspection."
