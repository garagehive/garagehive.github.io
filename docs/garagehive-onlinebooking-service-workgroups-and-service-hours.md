title: Setting Up Online Booking - Service Workgroups and Service Hours
---

# Service Workgroups and Service Hours
A **Service Workgroup** is a grouping of services that share similar characteristics, such as admin tasks, workshop repairs, tyre bookings, or MOT services. These workgroups help organise available services and ensure that bookings are assigned to the appropriate category.
**Service Hours**, on the other hand, specify the operational hours for each service workgroup, ensuring that customers can only book services within the defined time slots.
In the **Online Booking Setup** page:
1. From the menu bar, choose **Related**, followed by **Service Workgroups** or **Service Hours**.
2. Typically, these settings do not require changes unless specific modifications are needed to accommodate unique scheduling requirements.
