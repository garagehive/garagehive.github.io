### How to Automatically Block Customers Who Have Exceeded Their Credit Limit
Automatically blocking customers who have exceeded their credit limit ensures that no documents are created or posted for them until the balance owed goes below the credit limit set. Here's how to set up automatic customer blocking:
1. In the top right corner, choose the ![](media/search_icon.png) icon, enter **Sales & receivables Setup**, and select the related link.

3. If a customer should not be allowed further bookings, set the block on the **Customer Cards** page. Ensure the **Credit Limit** is defined and select **All** in the **Blocked** field to prevent any transactions once the credit limit is exceeded.
