# Importing an Internal Survey

Importing an internal survey is function available in the surveys to help you receive a survey file with the extension **stx**. For example, you could import a survey shared from an external HR consultant.

### To import an internal survey:
1. Search for **Surveys** at the top-right corner, and select it from the results. A list of previously created surveys is displayed.
2. From the actions bar, click on **Actions** and select **Import**.

3. The import action allows you to select the file with the **stx** extension that you want to import, then click **OK**.
4. The survey is imported and added to the list in the order of the survey numbering. The system will automatically import the survey number, description, questions, external consultant email address, and **Recurrence Settings** fields.

5. If you previously exported the survey with the same survey number and are now importing it, the **Template** field should be selected so that the survey can be updated rather than creating a new one.

> **Note:**

> When importing the survey as a **Template**, the participants settings remains unchanged.
