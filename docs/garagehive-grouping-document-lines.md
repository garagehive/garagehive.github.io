# How to Group Document Lines
Grouping document lines is a feature available in the estimates, vehicle inspection estimates and jobsheets; this feature enables you to group the document lines under the same job or category. In this article, we will look at the various ways of grouping the lines.

### Grouping document lines by creating a group and then adding the lines
The grouping feature is located above the **Lines** section in a document, under the name **Group Items**. To create a group:
1. Type in the name in the **Description** column.
2. Click on the cell under **Line Count** along the line you have created a group.

### Grouping document lines from the checklist attention items
While working from a vehicle inspection estimate, there are issues identified in the vehicle which require urgent attention. From these issues, you can create groups to enable you add items and labour. 

> **Example**
>
> Suppose you have identified that the vehicle requires service based on the mileage since the vehicle was last serviced. In that case, you can create a group under this heading (or rename the group to 'Full Servicing') and add servicing items and labour.

To create a group from the checklist attention items, you first need to work on the checklist lines and identify the 'requires urgent attention' lines. Then:
1. From the **Group Items** section actions bar, click on **Manage**.
2. Select **Add Checklist Attention Lines**; this takes the lines marked 'requires urgent attention' and pre-creates the groups for you.
3. The **Action Category** is pre-selected to **Required**.

4. After the groups have been created, add the items and labour in the document lines as required and match the lines with the pre-created groups. 
5. You can match the lines to the groups using the previous methods explained above.

### Grouping document lines from the service package card
To group the items and labour in a service package:
1. Click **Look Up**, and elect **Service Packages** from the document actions bar. 
2. Select the service package you want to be grouped.
3. Click on **Card** from the service packages versions page.

4. Select the slider **Create Group Items** from the opened service package card to group the items and labour in the service package.
5. Go back from the page and add the service package to the document; this creates a new group with the service package heading.

After creating the groups, when you preview or print the document, all the grouped items appear under the group's heading.
