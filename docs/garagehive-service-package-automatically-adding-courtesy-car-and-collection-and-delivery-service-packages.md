# Automatically Adding Courtesy Car and Collection and Delivery Service Packages

Most customer requests, such as 'Requires Courtesy Car,' must be remembered to include in the invoice when it is complete, which can be overlooked at times. The system can now be setup so that whenever a customer requests a courtesy car, the request is automatically added to the invoice; the same is true when the customer requests 'Collection and Delivery.'
