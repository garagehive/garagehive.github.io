# Automatically Adding Courtesy Car and Collection and Delivery Service Packages
Most customer requests, like 'Requires Courtesy Car,' need to be included in the final invoice, but it's easy to forget them. The system can now be setup so that any time a customer requests a courtesy car, it is automatically added to the invoice. The same applies for 'Collection and Delivery' requests as well.
